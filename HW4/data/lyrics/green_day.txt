I was a teenage teenager full of piss and vinegar
Living like a prisoner for haters

My life s a mess and school is just for suckers

Hit me with a dull knife
Sweet sour sickness
Can I get a witness

Take the money and crawl
Do I dare say please when I m on my knees
Take the money and crawl
Illegal tender
Going on a bender
Cold blooded killers
Of all motherfuckers
I m a nervous wreck enough to make you sick
Take the money and crawl
Oh yeah it s just my luck but I don t give a fuck
Take the money and crawl
This is the wildlife I m gonna take a dive
Take the money and crawl

Take the money and crawl
You can take a walk or you can suck my cock
Take the money and crawl
Oh yeah it s just my luck but I don t give a fuck
Take the money and crawl
What are the symptoms of our happiness and Civil War
Mano y mano in the stereo without a cure
I ve got a fever a non believer and it s killing me
Like a high school loser that will never
Ever ever ever fuck the prom queen
I got the shakes and I m on fire
I got a feeling and it s dangerous
I m gonna dance to something wild
I got a feeling and I need a rush
All hell is breaking loose and heaven only knows
I don t wanna be a Romeo
I don t wanna be a Romeo
I don t wanna be a Romeo no
I m hearing voices up inside my head
Oh what you thinkin
I need a sugar fix it s making me sick
Oh what you drinkin
I wanna drink all the poison in the water
I wanna choke like a dog that s on a collar
I am the child of coyote and bandito
I m drinking whiskey by the river doing yeyo
I got the shakes and I m on fire
I got a feeling and it s dangerous
I m gonna dance to something wild
I got a feeling and I need a rush
All hell is breaking loose and heaven only knows
I don t wanna be a Romeo
I don t wanna be a Romeo
I don t wanna be a Romeo no
I m in a crowd full of angels and demons
I m looking out for the jingoes and heathens
Nobody move and nobody gonna get hurt
Reach for the sky with your face in the dirt
Everybody is a star
Got my money and I m feeling kinda low
Everybody got a scar
Ain t it funny how we re running out of hope
Yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I got blood on my hands in my pockets
That s what you get turning bullets into rockets
I am a kid of a bad education
The shooting star of lowered expectation
Everybody is a star
Got my money and I m feeling kinda low
Everybody got a scar
Ain t it funny how we re running out of hope
Yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I m just a face in the crowd of spectators
To the sound of the voice of a traitor
Dirty looks and I m looking for a payback
Burning books in a bulletproof backpack
Everybody is a star
Got my money and I m feeling kinda low
Everybody got a scar
Ain t it funny how we re running out of hope
Yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Baby infidel in a dirty magazine
Telling dirty lies everybody can see
Kick it in the head and now I wanna see you dead
With a switchblade edge to the chest
I wanna stab you in the heart
I wanna stab you in the heart
Right in the bloody bloody heart ooh
For heaven s sake you re just a fake
And you know it ain t right
Pictures don t lie when you re front page news
Dagger to the heart coming down on you
I wanna stab you in the heart
I wanna stab you in the heart
Right in the bloody bloody heart ooh
For heaven s sake you re just a fake
Girl you know it ain t right
Daggers in my eyes and a rusty tambourine
Gimme my stiletto gonna do some surgery
Right to the heart
In the bloody oh in the bloody
I wanna stab you in the heart
In the bloody oh in the bloody
Right in the bloody bloody heart ooh
In the bloody oh in the bloody
For heaven s sake you re just a fake
And you know it ain t right
I m like a child looking off on the horizon
I m like an ambulance that s turning on the sirens
Oh I m still alive
I m like a soldier coming home for the first time
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine
Oh I m still alive
Am I bleeding Am I bleeding from the storm
Just shine a light into the wreckage so far away away
Cause I m still breathing
Cause I m still breathing on my own
My head s above the rain and roses
Making my way away
Cause I m still breathing
Cause I m still breathing on my own
My head s above the rain and roses
Making my way away
My way to you
I m like a junkie tying off for the last time
I m like a loser that s betting on his last dime
Oh I m still alive
I m like a son that was raised without a father
I m like a mother barely keeping it together
Oh I m still alive
Am I bleeding Am I bleeding from the storm
Just shine a light into the wreckage so far away away
Cause I m still breathing
Cause I m still breathing on my own
My head s above the rain and roses
Making my way away
Cause I m still breathing
Cause I m still breathing on my own
My head s above the rain and roses
Making my way away away
As I walked out on the ledge
Are you scared to death to live
I ve been running all my life
Just to find a home that s for the restless
And the truth that s in the message
Making my way away away
Cause I m still breathing
Cause I m still breathing on my own
My head s above the rain and roses
Making my way away
Cause I m still breathing
Cause I m still breathing on my own
My head s above the rain and roses
Making my way away
Cause I m still breathing
Cause I m still breathing on my own
My head s above the rain and roses
Making my way away
My way to you
Another one down at the mining town
Breakin it down for the lame wager
Callin the shots from the capital
All that we got was the banks of hope
Are we the last forgotten
Are we the long lost love
Are we the last forgotten
Are we the long lost love
This city isn t big enough for dreamers
We were all believers
It s the perfect crime
Only the lonely and wasted
Another black kid was shot in town
A man with the badge and a daytime show
Darkness falls on Graffitia
Death of a town in the afterglow
Are we the last forgotten
Are we the long lost love
Are we the last forgotten
Are we the long lost love
All souls go to heaven in Graffitia
Singing Hallelujah
It s the perfect crime
Only the lonely and wasted
If we re goin down for a good time
Life during war time
It s the perfect crime
Only the lonely and wasted
Are we the last forgotten
Are we the long lost love
Are we the last forgotten
Are we the long lost love
Another one down at the mining town
Are we the last forgotten
Callin the shots from the capital
Are we the long lost love
Another one down at the mining town
Are we the last forgotten
Callin the shots from the capital
Are we the long lost love
Another one down at the mining town
Are we the last forgotten
Callin the shots from the capital
Are we the last forgotten
Another one down at the mining town
Are we the last forgotten
Callin the shots from the capital
Are we the last forgotten
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Violence on the rise
Like a bullet in the sky
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Kindred Spirits sing
On the sick and suffering the suffering
The city on damage control
This is how we
Roll
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello they re the ones in control
Teach your children well
From the bottom of the well
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Hear the children sing
For the sick and suffering the suffering
The city on damage control
This is how we
Roll
Violence on the rise
Like a bullet in the sky
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Kindred Spirits sing
For the sick and suffering the suffering
The city on damage control

Say goodbye to the ones that we love
This is how we
I m running late to somewhere now
I don t want to be
Where the future and promises ain t what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise and bargain with my soul
How did life on the wild side ever get so dull
I ve grown up and am medicated
On my own Cellular waves
I put the riot in Patriot
And we all die in threes
I got a scene in the middle of the road
Im gonna take my time
I shop online so I can vote
At the speed of life
Im like a drone way up in the sky
Im a shooting star
There s a soldier thats freaking out
Because this is war
Ive grown up and am medicated
On my own Cellular waves
I put the riot in Patriot
And we all die in threes
All I want is weed and guns
A new catastrophe yeah
Here comes nothing theres nothing to lose
Its a small price we pay
When we all die in threes
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Hallelujiah I found my soul
Under the sofa pillows
Congratulations I found myself
Somewhere now
Somewhere Now
Scream with your hands up in the sky
Like you want to testify
For the life that s been deleted
Sing like a rebel s lullaby
Under the stars and stripes
For the lost souls that were cheated
We will be seen but not be heard
We are revolution radio
Operation no control
And the headline my love s bullet proof
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutants in surgery
And the headline legalize the truth
Give me rage like there s tear gas in the crowd
Do you want to live out loud
But the air is barely breathing
Rise of the slums to the obsolete
The dawn of the new airwaves
For the anti social media
We are revolution radio
Operation no control
And the headline my love s bullet proof
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutants in surgery
And the headline legalize the truth
We will be seen but not be heard
We are the songs of the disturbed
We are revolution radio
Operation no control
And the headline my love s bullet proof
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutants in surgery
And the headline legalize the truth
Life after youth
Faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love
First forgiveness
We were delinquants
Freaks of a faded memory
Outlaws when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We re outlaws of redemption baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We re outlaws of forever baby
Scars broken hearts
Breaking cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls
Bottle rockets
All that we wanted
It s for our lives beyond stars
Outlaws when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We re outlaws of redemption baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We re outlaws of forever baby
I ve got no supervision
Nothing will change my spirits
Race around with my innocence
I ll plead my innocence
But thats my best defense
When you are young
Outlaws when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We re outlaws of redemption baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We re outlaws all forever
I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train and you can t go back
Forever now forever now
you ll roam
Concrete dream
I m gonna make a scene radio
Covered in gasoline
Sleeping in reverse
And everybody s bouncing off the walls
Bombs away
It s just another day
Of idle threats
The secret alphabet
And I wouldn t sweat it
And everybody s bouncing off the walls
Im bouncing off the walls
Alright
Concrete kiss
Come on and do the twist
The radio
My little exorcist we re all getting pissed
And everybody s bouncing off the walls
Cause it s all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
Cause we re all bloody freaks
And we ll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes
I get my kicks and I wanna start a rager
I wanna dance like I m on the video
I got a fever for the violent behavior
I m sweatin bullets like a modern Romeo
Bang bang give me fame
Shoot me up to entertain woah oh
I am a semi automatic lonely boy
You re dead I m well fed
Give me death or give me head
Daddy s little psycho and mommy s little soldier
I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live and it s on my radio
I got my photobomb I got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else
Bang bang give me fame
Shoot me up to entertain woah oh
I am a semi automatic lonely boy
You re dead I m well fed
Give me death or give me head
Broadcasting from my room
And playing with my toys
I wanna be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah hoorah the hero of the hour
Daddy s little psycho and mommy s little soldier
I wanna be like the soldiers on the screen
It s my private holy war
Oh baby baby this is viva vendetta
For this is love or it s World War Zero
I wanna be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah hoorah the hero of the hour
Daddy s little psycho and mommy s little soldier
I wanna be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah hoorah the hero of the hour
Daddy s little psycho and mommy s little soldier

Bleeding heart
And the soul of Miss Teresa
Supernova
Cherry Cola

Getting drunk and fallin in the hedges
She s my weakness fucking genius

Oh oh I love you
Oh oh I do
I got a sentimental illness for you
Please don t go away oh yeah
I was a high school atom bomb
Going off on the weekends
Smoking dope and mowing lawns
And I hated all the new trends
Me and my friends sang
Woah
Here s to the middle of the road
At least it s better than here
Looking for a cause
But all I got was Santa Claus
I m hanging on a dream that s too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high too scared to dream
But too dumb to die
My daddy always was on strike
Going off with the teamsters
He said that Everything will be alright
Not every Sunday can be Easter
The picket line screamed
Woah
Don t cross
Don t cross the line because
You ll be a scab not a martyr
Looking for a cause
But all I got was camouflage
I m hanging on a dream that s too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
Too scared to dream
But too dumb to
Looking for a cause
But all I got was camouflage
I m hanging on a dream that s too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high too scared to dream
But too dumb to die
What good is love and peace on earth
When it s exclusive
Where s the truth in the written word
If no one reads it
A new day dawning
Comes without warning
So don t think twice
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
What part of history we learned
When it s repeated
Some things will never overcome
If we don t seek it
The world stops turning
Paradise burning
So don t think twice
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We run for cover
Like a skyscraper s falling down
Then I wander like a troubled mind
What good is love and peace on earth
When it s exclusive
Where s the truth in the written word
If no one reads it
A new day dawning
Comes without warning
So don t look twice
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
My name is Billie And I m freaking out
I thought before I was
And I can t get it figured out
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers
Screaming my memories
As if I was never there
Standing at the edge of the world
It s giving me the chills
Looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tangle
It s freaking me out
Burning lights and Blackouts
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
I m like a punk rocker on labor day
How the hell did I work so hard
To be born this way
I never learned to read or write so well
But I can play the guitar
Until it hurts like hell
Standing at the edge of the world
It s giving me the chills
Looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tango
It s freaking me out
Burning lights and Blackouts
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die
If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die
Oh I don t wanna think about tomorrow
Don t wanna think about it
Oh it doesn t matter anyway
I wanna start a revolution
I wanna hear it on my radio
Ill put it off another day
I want a new conspiracy
And the silence of a thousand cries
So hurry up
I want a better way to die
I m running late to Somewhere Now
I don t want to be
Where the future and promises
Ain t what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise
Or bargain with my soul
How did life on the wild side
Ever get so full
Somewhere now
Don t wanna think about tomorrow
Somewhere now
Don t wanna think about the road
Somewhere now
Oh I wanna start a revolution
Somewhere now
I ain t gonna stand in line no more
Don t wanna think about tomorrow
I ain t gonna stand in line no more
Don t wanna think about it
I ain t gonna stand in line no more
I wanna start a revolution
I wanna hear it on my radio I ll put it off another day
I ain t gonna stand in line no more
There s a trouble in the air
A rumble in the streets
A going out of business sale
And a race to bankruptcy
It s not one to 99 it s 99 to one
A common cause and a call to arms
For the health of our daughters and our sons
It s 99 revolutions tonight
There s a rat in the company
A bill on easy street
How the fuck did the working stiff
Become so obsolete
Hit the lights and bang your drum
And let your flag unfold
Cause history will prove itself
In the hall of justice and lost souls
It s 99 revolutions tonight
We live in troubled times
From the ghettos to an empty suburban home
We live in troubled times
And I m 99 percent sure that something s wrong
It s 99 revolutions tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
99 revolution tonight
Let s go crazy
Where can I find the city of shining lights
In an ordinary world
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world
The days into years roll by
It s where I live until I die
Ordinary World
What would you wish if you saw a shooting star
In an ordinary world
I d walk to the end of the earth and afar
In an ordinary world
Baby I don t have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world
Where can I find the city of shining lights
In an ordinary world
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world
Baby I don t have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world
What would you wish if you saw a shooting star
In an ordinary world
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They re all out without you
Having fun
Where have all the bastards gone
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Now collecting unemployment checks
Like a junkie along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city s motto gets pulverized
What s in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse
The town bishop is an extortionist
And he don t even know that you exist
Standing still when it s do or die
You better run for your fucking life
It s not over till your underground
It s not over before it s too late
This city s burning
It s not my burden
It s not over before it s too late
There s nothing left to analyze
Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself
And where will we all go when it s too late
And don t look back
You re not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St Jimmy is a figment of
Your father s rage and your mother s love
Made me the Idiot America
It s not over till your underground
It s not over before it s too late
This city s burning
It s not my burden
It s not over before it s too late
She said I can t take this place
I m leaving it behind
She said I can t take this town
I m leaving you tonight
Gonna build it up just to burn it down
You re a princess I m a fucking clown
Stop the presses cause I m killing time
Won t you be my bloody valentine
You re just a fucking kid
And no one ever gives you a break
You want a senorita
And now your heart is gonna break
You re angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces
Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Now I m singing out the alphabet
Averages of putting about my cigarette
We re at the cemetary so we can see the holiday lights
Waking up the dead and everything ll be alright
You re angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces
Alright
Stuck in the middle of Heaven and Hell
Alright
Trying to find my better angels
Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Stop the presses cause I m killing time
Won t you be my bloody valentine
You re just a fucking kid
And no one ever gives you a break
You want a senorita
And now your heart is gonna break
You re angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces

Breaking in a sweat like a bomb threat
Here s your silhouette fading out
Nothing left to lose detonate the fuse
Another break in this blow out
Ain t it beautiful so unusual
Life s a guess and it s running out
Living a cliche gonna seize the day
Bottle rockets
To celebrate celebrate celebrate
Carpe diem a battle cry
Are we all too young to die
Ask for reason and no reply
Are we all too young to die
Making a living making a killing
What s worth forgiving a lie
A blink of an eye barely scraping by
Dominated by passer bys
Feeling out of luck when the traffic s stuck
And you re feeling so left behind
Getting off a binge get a second wind
Another promise to make a change
Got a broken wing hear the angel sing
When the single is out of range
Ain t it strange
Carpe diem a battle cry
Are we all too young to die
Ask for reason and no reply
Are we all too young to die
Making a living making a killing
What s worth forgiving a lie
Making a living making a killing
What s worth forgiving a lie
Carpe diem a battle cry
Are we all too young to die
Ask for reason and no reply
Are we all too young to die 2x
All my life trouble follows me like a mystery girl
I ve been chasing down a memory like a mystery girl
I ve been getting lost searching my soul all around this town
I took a wrong turn at growing up and it s freaking me out
Back at school it never made much sense
Now I pay but I can t pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die I guess but that s the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to
Sex drugs violence
English math science
Safety in numbers
Gimme me gimme me danger
I don t wanna me an imbecile
But Jesus made me that way
All my life I ve been running wild like a runaway
Wherever the night takes me like a stoway
Back at school it never made much sense
Now I pay but I can t pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die I guess but that s the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to
Sex drugs violence

Now I pay but I can t pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die I guess but that s the way it goes

I woke up in a pool of sweat
At first I thought that I pissed the bed
Heart of stars in the midnight hour
The kiss of death from the Effiel Tower
And I went down like the speed of sound
You re out of sight but not out of mind
I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you
I ll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
I ll crash into you crash into you
Did you crash in my imagination too
Break a leg and you crushed my heart
I m a mess and you re a work of art
Count your blessings going zero to five
Steal a kiss and I took a dive
And I went down like the speed of sound
You re out of sight but not out of mind
I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you
I ll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
I ll crash into you crash into you
Did you crash in my imagination
I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you
And I fell for you
And I fell for you

I m going in to a state of shock
I can twist I can hardly walk
And I m holding on for life
Should I be concerned
My eyes are rolling in the back of my head
I m black and blue and I m in the red
And the silence is so loud
Should I be concerned
We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
Defy your judgement and demons
And save your last goodbye
My tears are putting out my cigarette
And I m singing out the alphabet
The way I remember
Should I be concerned
Making plans for my amnesia
I m going under anesthesia
I m holding on for life
Should I be concerned
We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
Defy your judgement and demons
And save your last goodbye
We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
Defy your judgement and demons
And save your last goodbye

Are you running around
Now you re crying at a bloody murder
Ashley
Are you bumming around
You are crying on my cold shoulder
Used a tangled mind with your puppet strings
You dangled your desires right in front of my face
You let me into the world but wouldn t let me drink
Swallowing my pride and I never even got the taste
But time comes around and I m not so naive
I ve finally lost touch cause you re so out of reach
You say that you re fine but I know that you ain t
You re looking like hell and you re no fucking saint

A wish on a shooting star
You are a filthy thought
In my memory
I ve tasted cigarettes and liquor on your breath
You used to call it speed but now it s crystal meth
Like when I loved you but you re scaring me to death
This careless memory and now I could care less
But time comes around and I m not so naive
I ve finally lost touch cause you re so out of reach
You say that you re fine but I know that you ain t

Where did you come
Where have you been
It looks like you fell into the trash bin
I m catching a train
I m crashing in the car
Packing for daylight
Shooting for the stars
Like a life long daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I ve got no destination
Cause i m a little boy named train
As we begin i ll tell you the same
Little boy named train
Don t know where i come from
But i know where i have been
Say
Serious people are funny to me
Funny people seem so serious
I m always lost and nothing will change
Give me directions and i ll get lost again
Like a life long daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I ve got no destination
Cause i m a little boy named train
As we begin i ll tell you the same
Little boy named train
Don t know where i come from
But i know where i have been

This whiskey sour amateur hour
Raise your glass and toast your friends
Someday we will fight again
Well your enemies your tragedies
Pocket knives and rusty chains
Where the hell is the old gang at
And all the losers
Can t even win for losing
And the beginners
Don t even know what song they re singing
When there s no one left around
And you re the last gang in town
And your heart can t even break
When it doesn t even pound
This broken scene is turning green
A brass knuckles left in the rain
Death wish kids among the living
I wanna ride on the divided
Anything but the mainstream
Where the fuck is your old gang man
And all the losers
Can t even win for losing
And the beginners
Don t even know what song they re singing
When there s no one left around
And you re the last gang in town
And your heart can t even break
When it doesn t even pound
So long
Didn t even say goodnight
So long
There s no where to go
When you re hiding in plain sight
When there s no one left around
And you re the last gang in town
And your heart can t even break
When it doesn t even pound
I lost my way
Oh baby this stray heart went to another
Can you recover baby
Oh you re the only one that I m dreaming of
Your precious heart was torn apart by me
And you you re not alone
Oh oh I m not where I belong
We re not alone
Oh oh I ll hold your heart
And never let go
Everything that I want
I want from you
But I just can t have you
Everything that I need
I need from you
But I just can t have you
I ve said it a thousand times
And now a thousand one
We ll never part
I ll never stray again from you
This dog is destined
For a home to your heart
We ll never part
I ll never stray again from you
You re not alone
Oh oh I m not where I belong
We re not alone
Oh oh I ll hold your heart
And never let go
Everything that I want
I want from you
But I just can t have you
Everything that I need

The guy you keep away from strangers
Im singing whoa oh oh

Oh baby when I see your pretty face
I say whoa oh oh
Gotta rest your fucking soul
Cause baby baby I was born to kill

I am a bullet in your magazine
Im singing whoa oh oh
Im out of control
Oh baby when I see your pretty face
I said whoa oh oh
Gotta rest your fucking soul
Cause baby baby eyes

Dance forever
Under the lights

Oh how you want it
You re begging for it
But you can t have it
Even if you try
It s in the clutches
In my hands of
This brutal love
Old toys
This plastic heart
Loners and fools
Are tearing me apart
Here comes trouble
The uninvited
This brutal love
Danger
Not quite at home
The eyes of temptation
The flesh on my bones
Hello stranger

Bad luck
Bitters and soda
Anguish and shame
The modern fool
Bad sex
Buy me a train wreck
Something for my troubled mind
Bad luck

Oh ride free ride

Far away far away
Waste away tonight
I m wearing my heart on a noose
Far away far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart s on the loose
Oh lights and action

Oh losers and choosers
Won t you please hold on my life
Oh hours and hours
Like the dog years of the day
Old story same old story
Won t you see the light of day
Far away far away
Waste away tonight
I m wearing my heart on a noose
Far away far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart s on the loose
Talk myself out of feeling
Talk my way out of control
Talk myself out of falling in love
Falling in love with you

Tonight my heart s on the loose
Tonight my heart s on the loose
Tonight my heart s on the loose
Waking up feeling naked
In my closest idle room that s vacant
Lost my nerve it s unnerving
I know there s something I m forgetting
I searched the moon I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls I hit the streets
I m pounding the pavement
Looking
I m missing you
I m missing you
You re not around
And I am a complete disaster
I m missing you
Remember it was the first time
I told you I loved you at the bus station
Don t forget cause it s not over
I m not lost cause I m just missing you
I searched the moon I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls I hit the streets
I m pounding the pavement
Looking
I m missing you
I m missing you
You re not around
And I am a complete disaster
I m missing you
Well she s my blood
And she s my soul
I get so lost
Out in the cold
I feel so far
Like this lone star
It gets so hard
When I m missing you
I m missing you
I m missing you
You re not around
And I am a fucking disaster
I m missing you
She is my drama queen
She is so wet and reckless
She is my drama queen
She dangles from her necklace
Chorus
Daddy s little bundle of joy
Out of a magazine
Everyone s drama queen
Is old enough to bleed now
She is my drama queen
Her life is now unfolding
There goes my drama queen
What do you think she s holding
Hey little drama queen
Did you find the savior
Oh little drama queen
You better call a lawyer
Chorus
Hey little drama queen
From Ny to San Francisco
Everyone s drama queen
I think she s going psycho
Daddy s little bundle of joy
Out of a magazine
Everyone s drama queen
Is old enough to bleed now
She s old enough to bleed now
We re in the worlds of forgotten
And lost inside your memory
You re dragging on your heart s been broken
Cause we all go down in history
Where in the world did the time go
It s where your spirit seems to roam
Like losing faith to our abandon
Or an empty hallway from a broken home
Don t look away
From the arms of a bad dream
Don t look away
Sometimes you re better lost than to be seen
I don t feel strange it s more like haunted
Another moment trapped in time
I can t quite put my finger on it
But it s like a child that was left behind
So we re in the worlds of forgotten
Like soldiers from a long lost war
We share the scars from our abandon
And what we remember becomes folklore
Well don t look away
From the arms of a bad dream
Don t look away
Sometimes you re better lost than to be seen
Don t look away
From the arms of a moment
Don t look away
From the arms of tomorrow
Don t look away
From the arms of a moment
Don t look away
From the arms of love
Don t look away
From the arms of a bad dream
Don t look away
Sometimes you re better lost than to be seen
Don t look away
From the arms of a moment
Don t look away
From the arms of tomorrow
Don t look away
From the arms of a moment
Don t look away
From the arms of love
Say hello from your window
Say goodbye from your car
Say goodnight from your pillow
Say so long from the stars
Take a walk out of my life
Sing to me a lullaby
Cradle songs for a midlife
Don t forget to pass me by
My imagination runs away
On this 8th avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the Whispering Wall
Before all the flames burn out
My imagination runs away
On this 8th avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
See you at the Whispering Wall
Before all the flames burn out
Hey little kid
Did you wake up late one day
You re not so young but you re still dumb
And you re numb to your old glory
But now it s gone
I fell in love
But it didn t catch your fall
Then I crashed to a wall
And I fell to pieces on the floor
Now you re sick to death
Bombs away
Here goes nothing the shining s over
Hey X Kid bombs away
Here goes nothing the shining s over and out
Over and out again
I once was old enough
To know better than I was
Too young to care but who cares
Probably would but Hollywood is dead and gone
You fell in love
But then you just fell apart
Like a kick in the head
You re an X Kid and you
Never even got started again
Bombs away
Here goes nothing the shining s over
Hey X Kid bombs away
Here goes nothing the shining s over and out
Over and out
And you were searching your soul
And you got lost and out of control
You went over the edge of joking
Died of a broken heart
Hey little kid
Did you wake up late one day
You re not so young but you re still dumb
You re an X kid and you
Never even got started again
Bombs away
Here goes nothing the shining s over
Hey X Kid bombs away
Here goes nothing the shining s over
Hey X Kid bombs away
Here goes nothing the shining s over
Hey X Kid bombs away
Here goes nothing the shining s over and out
Over and out
Over and over and out

We sold our souls and somehow shamed ourselves
So we wait for this judgment day
Write me a letter and send it to my graveyard
All fucked beyond intervention
Fuck the world this is my revolution

To bitch and surge
The tables turn
To crash and burn
Julianna homicide
Make my demons come to life
Well julianna homicide

Dust to dust when the red light flashes

To crash and burn
Julianna homicide
Make my demons come to life
Well julianna homicide

Amanda don t you know
That I still walk around
It s foggy round about
When I get back in town
I was a different man
From 5 seconds ago
And you re a different woman that s for certain
And I don t know a thing about
Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand
Amanda I couldn t be your man
Amanda don t you know
I wasn t strong enough
And in your wild mind
I wasn t smart enough
I was a different kid
From 15 years ago
And you re a different woman that s for certain
And I wanna know about
Is this some kind of love
That only hate would undertand
Amanda I couldn t be your man
I m not playing with your mind
Unless you think I am
Cause you were crushing my heart
Like a bad yearning round
Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand
Amanda I couldn t be your man
Maybe i ll see you tonight
Maybe i ll see you tonight
Wherever the night takes you
Maybe you ll see me too
The colder it gets you won t see me anymore
But there s still a chance i might walk to your door
Maybe the time is not right
I won t be seeing you tonight
Maybe i ll see you tonight
Maybe i ll see you tonight
This time
I ve gotta put my guard down
And pick myself up off the ground
And take the pain
It ll pass
The swelling never really lasts
But the scar remains remind me
That I m still living
Well it s not too late
Girl it s really not worth the fight
No one s right
Well it s time to walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Well the bigger that you come
Oh the harder you re gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away
Did you win
Oh baby did you lose
Now you re gonna lick your wounds anyway
When it comes back to you
When you fall
You re gonna need a parachute
Or a used pair of shoes to go
And walk away
Well it s not too late
Girl it s really not worth the fight
No one s right
Well it s time to walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Well the bigger that you come
Oh the harder you re gonna fall
Walk away

Well the bigger that you come
Oh the harder you re gonna fall
Walk away

I m too tired to be bored
I m too bored to be tired
And the silence is so deafening
It s like picking at a sore
I m too mental to go crazy
I m too drunk to be pure
And my mind is playing tricks on me
And I can t sleep tonight cause I m so tired
I can t take it anymore
And with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war
I don t want your sympathy
I don t want your honesty
I just want to get some peace of mind
It s only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don t want to hear it anymore
It s good to see you
But I really must admit
There s an odor in the air
And I think you look like shit
I can t stand from falling down
I m too sick to throw up
Everyone keeps talking
And they can t shut the fuck up cause I m so tired
I can t take it anymore
And with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war
I don t want your sympathy
I don t want your honesty
I just want to get some peace of mind
It s only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don t want to hear it anymore
I don t want to hear about it
I don t want to scream about it
I don t want to hear it anymore
Well I met a girl named Lady Cobra
Her black heart beat screams sinning clover
She gives me chills and fever blisters
She s serving spells and voodoo shakes
Well she just wants to get me high
Stick a needle in my eye
Reeks like a loss of temptation
living on my inner demons
I don t wanna suicide
I don t want this to end
I just wanna be your friend
Cuddle up with me real tight
Talk to me by candlelight
Do you wanna play a game of Twister
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter
I don t wanna suicide
I don t want this to end
I just wanna be your friend
Well I don t want to make you cry
Cross my heart and hope to die
Drawin blood and lonely stars
Drink and kiss for cheap guitars
I don t wanna suicide
I don t want this to end
I just wanna to be your friend
Oh your friend
Uncomfortable silence
I ll kill it if you want me to
I m like ultra violence
I ll kill it if you want me to
Out of sight out of mind
I m not the hurting kind
I ll make you surrender I ll make you surrender
I ll make you surrender I ll make you surrender
Stop when the red lights flash
I ll trade you blood for dirty cash
Life in the catacombs
You make me feel like I m alone
Out of sight out of mind
I m not the hurting kind
I ll make you surrender I ll make you surrender
I ll make you surrender I ll make you surrender
Out of sight out of mind
Just give in one more time
I ll make you surrender I ll make you surrender
I ll make you surrender I ll make you surrender
I ll make you surrender I ll make you surrender
I ll make you surrender I ll make you surrender

She s strung out on razors now
My heart isn t danger
She s strung out on razors now
Taking a ride to my old haunt
She s in my blood
I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color s candy apple girl
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife
What s that I hear
You wanna go for a ride
Don t be afraid boy to come inside
I got the thing that you want
The fix that you need
Chase this with a little lust and greed
I ll be the devil on your shoulder saying Hey boy come on
My black heart beats crimson and clover
Operator
Operator patch your boy in
This is nightlife and I ll get under your skin
Taking a ride to my old haunt
She s in my blood
I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color s candy apple girl
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife
Short of breath
Heart beat fast
Sounds like love but you know it won t last
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit
Hope there s more in your pants than a bus route
Red velvet walls line these sugar coated walls
Girls hanging bar stools for late last calls
This town is full of snakes
Mistakes and whiskey shakes
It s too late I already cut the brakes
I m rolling
Strolling into town
Come inside
Is it me or am I going crazy
It s just you
This dirty city is my sugar town
Sugar town
My little angel of death is my nightlife
Come inside
It s just you
Sugar town
Better make a move before I get bored
If you wanna explore my vocal chord
Baby girl on coke
Go dance in the cooch
One hand on my knee
One hand on the hooch
Why don t you stick around for one more round
This place is a circus and I know you ll be my clown
Cause I m a ringleader
I run the show
And only when I tell you will it be time to go
Taking a ride to my old haunt
She s in my blood
I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color s candy apple girl
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife
Hey boy
She is my nightlife
Hey boy
She is my nightlife
Hey boy
She is my nightlife
See you later
She is my nightlife
Is your heart singing out of tune
Are your eyes just singing the blues
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
No one really knows about your soul
And I barely even know your name
Burning rhythms and posting lies
For a bunch of fools drown in shame
Amy don t you go
I want you around
Singin woah please don t go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine
Do you wanna be a friend of mine
Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keep you out of harms way
Warding off all evil signs
But it never really kept you safe
Now you re too young for the golden age
Cause the record bin s been replaced
27 gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink
Amy don t you go
I want you around
Singin Whoa please don t go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine
Do you wanna be a friend of
Amy please don t go
Amy please don t go
Is your heart singing out of tune
Are you eyes just singing the blues
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
May I have this last dance
By chance if we should meet
Can you write me a lullaby
So we can sing you to sleep
Amy don t you go
I want you around
Singin Whoa please don t go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine
Do you wanna be a friend of mine
Do you wanna be a friend of mine
Seventeen and strung out on confusion
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion
I found out what it takes to be a man
Mom and dad will never understand
Secrets collecting dust but never forget
Skeletons come to life in my closet
I found out what it takes to be a man
Mom and dad will never understand
What ’ s happening to me
Seventeen and coming clean for the first time
I finally figured out myself for the first time
I found out what it takes to be a man
Mom and dad will never understand
What ’ s happened to me
Smell your technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake you like a ton of lightning
Staring in the sun is blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky
Dressed to the nines like a black cat s eyes
You re such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
And it goes
We re in a psychotic red alert
Your bouquet of flowers in the dirt
Radioactive and primal
Nuclear and so delightful
Wearing Dayglow where you know it hurts
Dressed to the nines like a black cat s eyes
You re such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
And it goes
Smell your technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake you like a ton of lightning
Staring in the sun is blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky
Dressed to the nines like a black cat s eyes
You re such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
And it goes
Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame HEY
The shame the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called Faith and Misery Hey
And bleed the company lost the war today
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protestor has crossed the line HEY
To find the money s on the other side
Can I get another Amen AMEN
There s a flag wrapped around a score of men HEY
A gag A plastic bag on a monument
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
The representative from California has the floor
Zieg Heil to the president gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass
Kill all the fags that don t agree
Trials by fire setting fire
Is not a way that s meant for me
Just cause hey hey
Just cause because we re outlaws YEAH
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday
Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Your thoughts are so unholy
In the holiness of old
On with Christian soldiers
Filled with jivin mind control
The blood left on the dancefloor
Running running red
The bullet that you asked for
Killing you to death
Unless you
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Voices in my head are saying
Shoot the DJ down
We are the vultures the dirtiest kind
We ll cut you once in your heart and your mind
OOh
Walking after dark
In the New York City park
I ll pick up what s left in the club
A pocket full of pills
Sodom and Gommorah in the century of thrills
The blood left on the dancefloor
Running running red
The bullet that you asked for
Killing you to death
Unless you
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Hold him under water until he suffocates and drowns
We are the vultures the dirtiest kind
We ll cut you once in your heart and your mind
OOh
Someones gonna get you boy
Shoot the DJ down
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the DJ down
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Someone shoot the DJ
Voices in my head are saying
Shoot the DJ down
Raise your hands now to testify
Your confession will be crucified
You re a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that s been sodomized
Stand up All the white boys
Sit Down And the black girls
You re the soldiers of the new world
Put your faith in a miracle
And It s non denominational
Join the choir we will be singing
In the church of wishful thinking
A fire burns today
of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics
Oh bless me lord for I have sinned
It s been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in the river of a shadow of doubt
And I ll be dressed in my sunday best
Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain t this uniform so flattering
I never asked you a god damned thing
A fire burns today
of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics
Don t test me
Second guess me
Protest me
You will disappear
I want to know who s allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
Missionary politicians
And the cops of a new religion
A fire burns today
of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside
Hey
You re giving me a heart attack
You re giving me a cardiac arrest
When I m sitting at the traffic light
Hey
I wanna get inside of you
I wanna crack your cranium
Delirium on the Lower East Side of your mind
Wanna be a Troublemaker
Wanna be a Troublemaker
Wanna be a Troublemaker
Wanna be a Troublemaker
Hey
I like your BMW
I like your BM excellent tits
With a tattoo of a pig sniffing glue
Hey
You re living at the W
You re looking like a Jezebel
Hot as hell
Sunburned in a pink bathing suit
Wanna be a Troublemaker
Wanna be a Troublemaker
Wanna be a Troublemaker
Wanna be a Troublemaker
Easy come and go gonna go it alone
Knock yourself out with a shot of Patron
I wouldn t say I m straight cause I m bent out of shape
From now till death
Do we party just before it s too late
Hey
You re giving me a heart attack
You re giving me a cardiac arrest
When I m standing at the traffic light
Hey
Bring me back to an hour ago
Time stands still as the years go by
Brown eyed girl
That s throwing down a bottle of old english
Back in the warehouse
Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From california to jane street
Kids alright alright as they ll ever be
cause you will always be my
Well you will always by my
You will always be my sweet sixteen
Sleep on the floor on cardboard
Stab out my heart like a dart board
Browned skinned girl
I had a dream about a long long time now
From the midwest to the beach
Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From california to jane street
Kids alright alright as they ll ever be
cause you will always be my
Well you will always by my
You will always be my sweet sixteen
Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From california to jane street
Kids alright alright as they ll ever be
cause you will always be my
Well you will always by my
You will always be my sweet sixteen

cause they re all so fucking useless
A bunch of shit talking drama queens
And they re all filled with excuses
I wanna find me a better scene
Where it s not the same opinion
I d rather go to a funeral
Than into this high school reunion
April fool but you re falling in love
But now you re sucking on a doorknob
That I slammed in your face
Life s so cruel crushing bastard crime
And you re a stupid motherfucker
And you re doing the time cause
We re all crazy you re all crazy

A loss of control

Hanging out all by myself at least I m in good company
Hey isn t that old whatshisface

And I never liked you anyway
April fool but you re falling in love

Life s a cruel cruisin son of a bitch
And you re a stupid motherfucker
Save the shit for the pigs cause

A loss of control
Born into nixon I was raised in hell
A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
The last one born the first one to run
My town was blind from refinery sun
My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero
21st century breakdown
I once was a lost but never was found
I think I am losing what s left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline
I was made of poison and blood
Condemnation is what I understood
Videogames to the tower s fall
Homeland security could kill us all
My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero
21st century breakdown
I once was lost but never was found
I think I am losing what s left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline
We re the cries of the class of 13
Born in the era of humility
We re the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969
My name is no one
The long lost son
Born on the 4th of july
Raised in an era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive
I am a nation
A worker of pride
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands
and the means to an end
is all that I have to show
I swallowed my pride
and I choked on my faith
I ve given my heart and my soul
I ve broken my fingers
and lied through my teeth
the pillar of damage control
I ve been to the edge
and I ve thrown the bouquet
of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room
Wasting my time
and waiting for judgement day
I praise liberty
The freedom to obey
Is the song that strangles me
Well don t cross the line
Dream America Dream
I can t even sleep
From the light s early dawn
Scream America Scream
Believe what you see from heroes and cons
I don t wanna go back home
I don t wanna kiss goodnight
Let us paralyse this moment till it dies
To the end of the earth
Under the valley of the stars
There s a car crashing
Deep inside my heart
Take a ride through the avenues
Across the great divide
There s a siren screaming
I m alive it cries
Red alert is the color
Of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this
Moment passing by
Till passing by
Take a ride through the avenues
Across the great divide
There s a siren screaming
I m alive it cries
Red alert is the color
Of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this
Moment passing by
Let s go crazy
Oh come away with me tonight
With Cigarettes and Valentines
Cigarettes and Valentines
So come away with me tonight
With Cigarettes and Valentines
Oh come away with me tonight
With Cigarettes and Valentines
Cigarettes and Valentines
I heard you crying loud
all the way across town
You ve been searching for that someone
and it s me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well don t get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I m just roaming for the moment
Sleazin my back yard so don t get so uptight
you been thinking about ditching me
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I ll be found
When I come around
I heard it all before
So don t knock down my door
I m a loser and a user
so I don t need no accuser
to try and slag me down
because I know you re right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out
that your selfdoubt means nothing was ever there
You can t go forcing something if it s just not right
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I ll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
Hey Gloria
Are you standing close to the edge
Lookout to the setting sun
The brink of your vision
Eternal youth is
A landscape from the lie
The cracks of my skin can prove
As the years will testify
Say your prayers and light a fire
Were going to start a war
Your slogans a gun for hire
It s what we waited for
Hey Gloria
This is what were on the edge
The fight of our lives been drawn to
This undying love
Gloria Viva La Gloria
You blast your name
In graffiti on the walls
Falling thought broken glass that s
Slashing thought your spirit
I can hear it like a jilted crowd
Gloria Where are you Gloria
You found a home
In all your scars and ammunition
You made your bed in salad days
Amongst the ruin
Ashes to ashes of our youth
She smashed her knuckles into winter
As autumns wind fades into black
She is the saint on all the sinners
The one that s fallen thought the cracks
So don t put away your burning light
Gloria Where are you Gloria
Don t lose your faith
To your lost naivete
Weather the storm and don t look
Back on last november
When your banner where burning down
Gloria Viva La Gloria
Send me you amenesty down
To the broken hearted
Bring us the season
That we always will remember
Don t let the bonfires go out
So Gloria
Send out your message of the light
That Shadow in the night
Gloria Where s your undying love
Tell me the story of your life
I declare I don t care no more
I m burning up and out and growing bored
In my smoked out boring room
My hair is shagginng in my eyes
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
To drive along these shit town lights
I m not growing up I m just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
Apathy has rained on me
Now I m feeling like a soggy dream
So close to drowning but I don t mind
I ve lived inside this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
Hell who needs them anyway
I m not growing up I m just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I m not growing up I m just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I m not growing up I m just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I m not growing up I m just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
Here we go again infatuation
Touches me just when I
Thought that it would end
Oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but
I m not sure exactly what you re thinking
I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of effection
But to find that it s not different at all
I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
That s when I say
What the hey
Would we last forever
You and I together hand in hand
We run away far away
I m in for nasty weather
But I ll take whatever you can
Give that comes my way far away
My friend drove off the other day
And now he s gone and all they say
Is you gotta live cuz life goes on
But now I see I m mortal too
I can t live my life like you
Gotta live it up while life goes on
And I think that it s all right
That I do what I like
Cuz that s the way I wanna live
And so I give and I m still givin
And now I wonder bout my friend
If he gave all he could give
Cuz he lived his life like I live mine
If you could see inside my head
Then you d start to understand
The things I value in my heart
And I think that it s all right
That I do what I like
Cuz that s the way I wanna live
And so I give and I m still givin
You know that
I know that
You re watchin me
And I think that it s all right
That I do what I like
Cuz that s the way I wanna live
And so I give and I m still givin
Gotta make a plan
Gotta do what s right
Can t run around in circles
If you wanna build a life
But I don t wanna make a plan
For a day far away
While I m young and while I m able
All I wanna do is
She
She screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self control
Are you locked up in a world
That s been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I m taking heed just for you
She
She s figured out
All her doubts were someone else s point of view
Waking up this time
To smash the silence with the brick of self control
Are you locked up in a world
That s been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I m taking heed just for you
Are you locked up in a world
That s been planned out for you
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I m taking heed just for you
I m on a mission
I made my decision
To lead a path of self destruction
A slow progression
Killing my complexion
And it s rotting out my teeth
I m on a roll
No self control
I m blowing off steam with
Meth Amphetamine
Don t know what I want
That s all I ve got
And I m picking scabs off my face
Every hour my blood is turning sour
And my pulse is beating out of time
I found a treasure
Filled with sick pleasure
And it sits on a thin white line
I m on a roll
No self control
I m blowing off steam with
Meth Amphetamine
Don t know what I want
That s all I ve got
And I m picking scabs off my face
I m on a mission
I got no decision like a cripple
Running the rat race
Wish in one hand and shit in the other
And see which one gets filled first
I m on a roll
No self control
I m blowing off steam with
Meth Amphetamine
Don t know what I want
That s all I ve got
And I m picking scabs off my face
Geek Stink Breath
Do you know What s worth fighting for
When It s not worth dying for
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating
Does the pain weight out the pride
And you look for a place to hide
Did someone break your heart inside
You re in ruins
One 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One 21 guns
Throw up your arms
Into the sky
You and I
When you re at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn t pass
Nothing s ever built to last
You re in ruins
One 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One 21 guns
Throw up your arms
Into the sky
You and I
Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone
When it s time to live and let die
And you can t get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You re in ruins
One 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One 21 guns
Throw up your arms
Into the sky
One 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One 21 guns
Throw up your arms
Into the sky
You and I
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father s come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when september ends
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when september ends
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father s come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
Don t wanna be an American Idiot
Don t want a nation under the new media
Can you hear the sound of hysteria
The subliminal mind Fuck America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn t meant to be ok
Television dreams of tomorrow
We re not the ones meant to follow
For that s enough to argue
Maybe I am the faggot America
I m not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn t meant to be ok
Television dreams of tomorrow
We re not the ones meant to follow
For that s enough to argue
Don t wanna be an American Idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
Is going out to Idiot America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn t meant to be ok
Television dreams of tomorrow
We re not the ones meant to follow
For that s enough to argue
A thought burst in my head and I need to tell you
It s news that I for thought
Was it a dream that happened long ago
I think that I just forgot
Well it hasn t been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
There s a boy who fogs his world
and now he s getting lazy
There s no motivation
and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand
but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up
or he s gonna end up quitting
I shuffle through my mind
To see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream
that happened long ago
Oh well
Never mind
Dreaming
I was only dreaming
of another place and time
Where my family s from
Singing
I can hear them singing
When the rain had washed away
All these scattered dreams
Dying
Everyone s reminded
Hearts are washed in misery
Drenched in gasoline
Laughter
There is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday
Now live in the underground
Life before the lobotomy
Christian sang the eulogy
Sign my love a lost memory
From the end of the century
Well it s enough to make you sick
To cast a stone and throw a brick
When the sky is falling down
It burned your dreams into the ground
Christian s lesson is what he s been sold
We are normal and selfcontrolled
Remember to learn to forget
Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes
Well I m not stoned
I m just fucked up
I got so high I can t stand up
I m not cursed cause I ve been blessed
I m not in love cause I m a mess
Like refugees
We re lost like refugees
Like refugees
We re lost like refugees
The brutality of reality
Is the freedom that keeps me from
Dreaming
I was only dreaming
of another place and time
Where my familys from
Singing
I can hear them singing
When the rain had washed away
All theses scattered dreams
Dying
Everyone s reminded
Hearts are washed in misery
Drenched in gasoline
Laughter
There is no more laughter
songs of yesterday
Now live in the underground
Another turning point
A fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist
Directs you where to go
So make the best of this test
And don t ask why
It s not a question
But a lesson learned in time
It s something unpredictable
But in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
So take the photographs
And still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf
Of good health and good time
Tattoos of memories
And dead skin on trial
For what it s worth
It was worth all the while
It s something unpredictable
But in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It s something unpredictable
But in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It s something unpredictable
But in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
I got under the grip
Between this modern hell
I got the rejection letter in the mall and
It was already ripped to shreds
Seasons in a ruin and
This bitter pill is chased with blood
There s fire in my veins
and it s pouring out like a flood
Woah Christian s Inferno
Woah Christian s Inferno
Woah Christian s Inferno
Woah Christian s Inferno
This diabolic state is gracing my existence
Like a catastrophic baby
Maybe maybe you re the chemical reaction
I am the atom bomb
I am the chosen one
Toxin your reservoir
and then return man to ape
Woah Christian s Inferno
Woah Christian s Inferno
Woah Christian s Inferno
Woah Christian s Inferno
Woah Christian s Inferno
Woah Christian s Inferno
Woah Christian s Inferno
Woah Christian s Inferno
I text a postcard sent to you
Did it go through
Sending all my love to you
You re the moonlight of my life everynight
Giving all my love to you
My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles till I found you
I m here to honour you
If I lose everything in the fire
I m sending all my love to you
With every breath that I am worth
Here on earth
I m sending all my love to you
So if you dare to second guess
You can rest
Assured all my love s for you
My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles till I found you
I m here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I m sending all my love to you
My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles till I found you
I m here to honour you
If I lose everything in the fire
Did I ever make it through
Sing us a song of the century
That s louder than bombs
And eternity
The era of static and contraband
That s leading us into the promised land
Tell us a story that s by candlelight
Waging a war and losing the fight
They re playing the song of the century
Of panic and promise and prosperity
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me
She puts her make up on
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She s got her little book of conspiracies
Right in her hand
She is paranoid like
Endangered species headed into extinction
She is one of a kind
She s the last of the american girls
She wears her overcoat
for the coming of the nuclear winter
She is riding her bike
Like a fugitive of critical mass
She s on a hunger strike
For the ones who won t make it for dinner
She makes enough to survive
For a holiday of working class
She s runaway of the establishment incorporated
She won t cooperate
She s the last of the american girls
She plays her vinyl records
Singing songs on the eve of destruction
She s a sucker for
All the criminals breaking the laws
She will come in first
For the end of western civilization
She s an endless war
She s a hero for the lost cause
Like a hurricane
In the heart of the devastation
She s a natural disaster
She s the last of the american girls
She puts her makeup on
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She s got her little book of conspiracies
Right in her hand
She will come in first
For the end of western civilization
She s a natural disaster
She s the last of the american girls
Desperate
But not Hopeless
I feel so useless
In the Murder City
Desperate
But not helpless
The clock strikes midnight
In the Murder city
I m wide awake
After the riot
This demostration
Of our anguish
This empty langhter
Has no reason
Like a bottle
Of your favorite poison
We are the last call
And were so pathetic
Desperate
But not Hopeless
I feel so useless
In the Murder City
Desperate
But not helpless
The Clock strikes midnight
In the Murder city
Christian is crying
In the bathroom
And i just wanna
Find my cigarretes
We ve come so far
We ve been so wasted
It s written
All over our faces
We are the last call
And were so pathetic
Desperate
But not Hopeless
I feel so useless
In the Murder City
Desperate
But not helpless
The Clock strikes midnight
In the Murder city
Well I ve got a fever
A non believer
I m in a state of grace
For I m the caesar
I m gonna seize the day
Well call of the banshee
Hey x7
As god as my witness
The infidels are gonna pay
Well call the assassin
The orgasm
A spasm of love and hate
For what will divide us
The righteous and the meek
Well call of the wild
Hey x7
Death to the girl at the and of the serenade
Vendetta Sweet Vendetta
This beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite
I am a killjoy from detroit
I drink from a well of rage
I feed off the weakness with all my love
Call up the captain
Hey x7
Death to the lover that you were dreaming of
This is a stand off
Of molotov cocktails
on the house You thought I was a write off
You better think again
Call the peacemaker
Hey x7
I m gonna send you back to the place where it all
began
Vendetta sweet vendetta
This beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite
Well now the caretakers the undertaker
Now I m gonna go out and get the peacemaker
This is the neo St Valentines massacre
Well call up the gaza
Hey x7
Death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well Death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well Death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well Death to the ones at the end of the serenad
Little girl little girl
Why are you crying
Inside your restless soul your heart is dying
Little one little one
Your soul is purging
Of love and razor blades
Your blood is surging
Runaway
From the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
Your a stray for the salvation army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go
Little girl little girl
Your life is calling
The charlatans and saints of your abandon
Little one little one
The sky is falling
The lifeboat of deception is now sailing
In the wake all the way
No rhyme or reason
Your bloodshot eyes
Will show your heart of treason
Little girl little girl
You dirty liar
You re just a junkie
Preaching to the choir
Runaway
From the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
Your a stray for the salvation army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go
The traces of blood
Always follow home
Like the mascara tears
From your getaway
Your walking with blisters
And running with shears
So wholy
Sister of grace
Runaway
From the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
Your a stray for the salvation army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go
Starry nights city lights
Coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers
In my head
Are we we are are we we are the waiting unknown
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found city bound in my dreams
And screaming
Are we we are Are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are Are we we are the waiting
Forget me nots second thoughts
Live in isolation
Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
Are we we are Are we we are the waiting
unknown
The rage and love the story of my life
The Jesus of suburbia is a lie
And screaming
Are we we are Are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are Are we we are the waiting
unknown
Are we we are Are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are Are we we are the waiting
unknown
Are we we are Are we we are the waiting
unknown
I ve got a really bad disease
It s got me begging
On my hands and knees
So take me to the emergency
Cause something seems to be missing
Somebody take the pain away
It s like an ulcer bleeding in my brain
So send me to the pharmacy
So I can lose my memory
I m elated
Medicated
Lord knows I tried to find a way to run away
I think they found another cure
for broken hearts and feeling insecure
You d be surprised what I endure
What makes you feel so selfassured
I need to find a place to hide
You never know what could be
waiting outside
The accidents that you could find
It s like some kind of suicide
So what ails you is what impales you
I feel like I ve been crucified to be satisfied
I m a victim of my symptom
I m my own worst enemy
You re a victim of your symptom
You are your own worst enemy
Know your enemy
I m elated
Medicated
I m my own worst enemy
So what ails you is what impales you
You are your own worst enemy
You re a victim of the system
You are your own worst enemy
You re a victim of the system
You are your own worst enemy
Part I
I m the son of rage and love
The Jesus of suburbia
From the bible of none of the above
On a steady diet of
Soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my sins in hell
As far as I can tell
At least the ones I got away with
And there s nothing wrong with me
This is how I m supposed to be
In the land of make believe
That don t believe in me
Get my television fix
sitting on my crucifix
A living room on my private womb
While the moms and brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes
And mary jane
To keep me insane
Doing someone else s cocaine
And there s nothing wrong with me
This is how I m supposed to be
In the land of make believe
That don t believe in me
Part Ii City Of The Damned
At the center of the Earth
In the parking lot
Of the 7 11 where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says home is where your heart is
But what a shame
Cause everyone s heart
Doesn t beat the same
It s beating out of time
City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
city of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to care
I read the graffiti
In the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn t say much
But it only confirmed that
The center of the earth
Is the end of the world
And I could really care less
City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
city of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
Noone really seems to care
Hey
Part Iii I Don t Care
I don t care if you don t
I don t care if you don t
I don t care if you don t care X5
I don t care
Everyone s so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrits
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of suburbia
Land of make believe
And it don t believe in me
Land of make believe
And I don t believe
And I don t care
I don t care
Part Iv Dearly Beloved
Dearly beloved are you listening
I can t remember a word
that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed
The space that s in between insane and insecure
Oh therapy can you please fill the void
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed
Nobody s perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word
and that s my best excuse
Part V Tales Of Another Broken Home
To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run to run away
To find what you believe
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
I lost my faith to this
This town that don t exist
So I run
I run away
The light of masochist
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time
I don t feel any shame
I won t apologize
When there ain t nowhere you can go
Running away from pain
When you ve been victimized
Tales from another broken home
You re leaving
You re leaving
You re leaving
Ah You re leaving home
Well I crossed the river
Fell into the sea
Where the non believers
Go beyond belief
Then I scratched the surface
In the mouth of hell
Running out of service
In the blood I fell
Well I I just want to see the light
And I I don t want to lose my sight
Well I I just want to see the light
And I need to know what s worth the fight
I ve been wasted
Pills and alcohol
And I ve been chasing
Down the pool halls
Then I drank the water
From a hurricane
And I set a fire
Just to see the flame
Well I I just want to see the light
And I I don t want to lose my sight
Well I I just want to see the light
And I need to know what s worth the fight
Well I crossed the desert
Reaching higher ground
Then I pound the pavement
To take the liars down
But it s gone forever
But never too late
Where the ever after
Is in the hands of fate
Well I I just want to see the light
And I I don t want to lose my sight
Well I I just want to see the light
And I need to know what s worth the fight
I sit around and watch the tube but nothing s on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I m sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
and I m fuckin lazy
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I m so damn bored I m going blind
And I smell like shit
Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
I m sure as hell can t do it by myself
I m feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I m so damn bored I m going blind
And I smell like shit
I got no motivation
Where is my motivation
No time for the motivation
Smoking my inspiration
I sit around and watch the phone but no one s calling
Call me pathetic
Call me what you will
My mother says to get a job
But she doesn t like the one she s got
When masturbation s lost its fun
You re fucking lonely
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I m so damn bored I m going blind
And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
slipping away to paradise
Some say Quit or I ll go blind
But it s just a myth
I m not fucking around
I think I m coming out
All the deceivers and cheaters
I think we ve got a bleeder right now
Want you to slap me around
Want you to knock me out
Well you missed me kissed me
Now you better kick me down
Maybe you re the runner up
But the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in
Horseshoes and hand grenades
I m gonna burn it all down
I m gonna rip it out
Well everything that you employ
Was meant for me to destroy
To the ground now
So don t you fuck me around
Because I ll shoot you down
I m gonna drink fight and fuck
And pushing my luck
All the time now
Maybe you re the runner up
But the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in
Horseshoes and hand grenades
Demolition self destruction
What to annihilate
The age old contradiction
Demolition self destruction
What to annihilate
The age old contradiction
Demolition self destruction
What to annihilate
The old age
I m not fucking around
I think I m coming out
All the deceivers and cheaters
I ve think we ve got a bleeder right now
I m not fucking around
Can you hear the sound of the static noise
Blasting out in stereo
Cater to the class and the paranoid
Music to my nervous system
Advertising love and religion
Murder on the airwaves
Slogans on the brink of corruption
Vision of blasphemy war and peace
Screaming at you
I can t see a thing in the video
I can t hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age
Billboard on the rise in the dawns landscape
Working your insanity
Tragic A la madness and concrete
Coca cola execution
Conscience on a cross and
You re hearts in a vice
Squeezing out your state of mind
Are what you own that you cannot buy
What a fucking tragedy strategy
Screaming at you
I can t see a thing in the video
I can t hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age x2
Hey hey it s the static age
This is how the west was won
Hey hey It s the static age millenium
All I want to know
Is a god damned thing
Not what s in the medicine
All I want to do is
I want to breathe
Batteries are not included
What s the latest way that a man can die
Screaming Hallelujah
Singing out the dawns early light
The silence of the rotten forgotten
Screaming at you
I can t see a thing in the video
I can t hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age x4
The static age
1 Mass Hysteria
Sing us the song of the century
That sings like American eulogy
The dawn of my love and conspiracy
Of forgotten hope and the class of 13
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Red alert is the color of panic
Elevated to the point of static
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics
And the neighborhoods a loaded gun
Idle thought leads to full throttle screaming
And the welfare is asphyxiating
Mass confusion is all the new rage
And it s creating a feeding ground
For the bottom feeders of hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
True sounds of maniacal laughter
And the deaf mute is misleading the choir
The punch line is a natural disaster
And it s sung by the unemployed
Fight fire with a riot
The class was is hanging on a wire
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar
When he said
It s just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
There s a disturbance on the Oceanside
They tapped into the reserve
They static response is so unclear now
Mayday this is not a test
As the neighborhood burns America is falling
Vigilantes warning you
Calling Christian and Gloria
2 Modern World
I don t want to live in the modern world
I don t want to live in the modern world
I don t want to live in the modern world
I don t want to live in the modern world
I m the class of 13
In the era of dissent
A hostage of the soul
On a strike to pay the rent
The last of the rebels
Without a common ground
I m gonna light a fire
Into the underground
I don t want to live in the modern world
I don t want to live in the modern world
I don t want to live in the modern world
I don t want to live in the modern world
I am a nation
Without bureaucratic ties
Deny the allegation as it s written fucking lies
I want to take a ride to the great divide
Beyond the up to date
And the neo gentrified
The high definition for the low resident
Where the value of your mind
Is not held in contempt
I can hear the sound of
A beating heart
That bleeds beyond a system
That s falling apart
With money to burn
On a minimum wage
Cause I don t give a shit
About the modern age
I don t want to live in the modern world
I don t want to live in the modern world
I don t want to live in the modern world
I don t want to live in the modern world
I don t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I don t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I don t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I don t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria

St Jimmy s comin down across the alleyway
Upon the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a sillohette
He s insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of
1 2
1 2 3 4
My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out
Suicide comando that your momma talked about
King of the forty thieves
And I m here to represent
That needle in the vein of the establishment
I m the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city under halo of lights
The product of war and fear that we ve been victimized
I m the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
Are you talking to me
I ll give you something to cry about
St Jimmy
My name is St Jimmy I m a son of a gun
I am the one that s from the way outside St Jimmy
A teenage assasin exucuting some fun
In the cult of the life of crime St Jimmy
I d really hate to say it but I told you so
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down old boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
I m the resident leader of the lost and found St Jimmy
It s comedy and tragedy
It s St Jimmy
And that s my name
and don t you fuck wear it out
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I m cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Am I just stoned
I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it s lack of sex that s bringing me down
I went to a whore
She said my life s a bore
Just quit my whining cause it s bringing her down
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I m cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Am I just stoned
Grasping to control
So I better hold on
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I m cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Am I just stoned
King for a day

King for a day Princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong

HEY
HO
GO
HEY
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don t know where it goes
But it s home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I m the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone I walk alone
I walk alone I walk a
Chorus
My shadow s the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart is the only thing that s beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone
ah ah ah ah ah ah aaah ah ah ah ah
I m walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge
And where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What s fucked up and everything s alright
Check my vital signs to know I m still alive
And I walk alone
I walk alone I walk alone
I walk alone I walk a
Chorus
My shadow s the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart is the only thing that s beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone
ah ah ah ah ah ah aaah ah ah ah ah
I walk alone I walk a
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of broken dreams
When the city sleeps
And I m the only one and I walk a
Chorus
My shadow s the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart is the only thing that s beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone
I m having trouble trying to sleep
I m counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
And still I try
No rest for crosstops in my mind
On my own here we go
My eyes feel like they re going to bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own here we go
My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My sense is dulled
Passed the point of delerium
On my own here we go
My eyes feel like they re going to bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own here we go
Hey mister where you headed
Are you in a hurry
I need a lift to happy hour say oh no
Do you brake for distilled spirits
I need a break as well
The well that inebriates the guilt
1 2 1 2 3 4
Cold turkey s getting stale
Tonight I m eating crow
Fermented salmonella poison oak no
There s a drought at the fountain of youth
And I m dehydrating
My tongue is swelling up
I say 1 2 1 2 3 4
Troubled times
You know I cannot lie
I m off the wagon and I m hitchin a ride
There s a drought at the fountain of youth
And now I m dehydrating
My tongue is swelling up
I say
Shit
Troubled times
You know I cannot lie
I m off the wagon and I m hitchin a ride
Hitchin a ride 8
I wanna be the minority
I don t need your authority
Down with the moral majority
Cause I wanna be the minority
I pledge allegiance to the underworld
One nation under dog
There of which I stand alone
A face in the crowd
Unsung against the mold
Without a doubt
Singled out
The only way I know
I wanna be the minority
I don t need your authority
Down with the moral majority
Cause I wanna be the minority
Stepped out of the line
Like a sheep run from the heard
Marching out of time
To my own beat now
The only way I know
One light one mind
Flashing in the dark
Blinded by a silence of a thousand broken hearts
For crying out loud she screamed into me
A free for all
fuck em all
You are your own sight
I wanna be the minority
I don t need your authority
Down with the moral majority
Cause I wanna be the minority
One light one mind
Flashing in the dark
Blinded by a silence of a thousand broken hearts
For crying out loud she screamed into me
A free for all
fuck em all
you are your own sight
Cause I wanna be the minority
I don t need your authority
Down with the moral majority
Cause I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority x3
She s
An Extraordinary girl
In an ordinary world
And she can t seem to get away
He
Lacks the courage in his mind
Like a child left behind
Like a pet left during the rain
She s all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying
She sees the mirror of herself
An image she wants to sell
To anyone willing to buy
He steals the image in her kiss
From her heart s apocalypse
From the one called whatsername
She s all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying
She s all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days she feels like dying
Some days it s not worth trying
Now that they ve pulled the fun in
She gets so sick of crying
She s
An Extraordinary girl
An Extraordinary girl
An Extraordinary girl
An Extraordinary girl
Take away the sensation inside
Bittersweet migraine in my head
It s like a throbbing toothache of the mind
I can t take this feeling anymore
Drain the pressure from the swelling
The sensation s overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright
Tell me that I won t feel a thing
So give me novacaine
Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feeling and that s alright
Jimmy says it s better than air
I ll tell you why
Drain the pressure from the swelling
The sensations overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything will be alright
Tell me that I won t feel a thing
So give me novacaine
Oh Novacaine
Drain the pressure from the swelling
The sensation s overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright
Tell me Jimmy I won t feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
She s a rebel
She s a saint
She s the salt of the earth
And she s dangerous
She s a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction
From Chicago to Toronto
She s the one that they
Call ol whatsername
She s the symbol
Of resistance
And she s holding on my
Heart like a hand grenade
Is she dreaming
What I m thinking
Is she the mother of all bombs
Gonna detonate
Is she trouble
Like I m trouble
Make it a double
Twist of fate
Or a melody that
She sings of revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can t define
Well nothing comes to mind
She sings of revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can t define
Well nothing comes to mind
She s a rebel
She s a saint
She s the salt of the earth
And she s dangerous
She s a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction
She s a rebel
She s a saint
She s the salt of the earth
And she s dangerous
She s a rebel
Vigilante
Missing link on the brink
Of destruction
She s a rebel
She s a rebel
She s a rebel

Part I The Death Of St Jimmy
My heart is beating from me
I m standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live
In the streets of shame
Where you ve lost your dreams in the rain
There s no sign of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There s a glow of light
The St Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust
What the hell s your name
What s your pleasure what is your pain
Do you dream to much
Do you think what you need is a crutch
In the crowd of pain
St Jimmy comes without any shame
He says we re fucked up
But we re not the same
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame
Jimmy died today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind
Is my own private suicide
Part II East 12th St
Well nobody cares
Well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares
Well nobody cares
Well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares
Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th st
He s not listening to a word now
He s in his own world
And he s daydreaming
He d rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life s on the line with anxiety now
And she had enough
And he had plenty
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here
So far away
I don t want to stay
Get me out of here right now
Just wanna be free
Is there a possibility
Get me out of here right now right
This life like dream ain t for me
Part III Nobody likes you
I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After 10 cups of coffee
And you re still not here
Dreaming of a song
But something went wrong
And you can t tell anyone
Cause noone s here
Left me here alone
And I should ve stayed home
After 10 cups of coffee
I m thinking where d you go
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
Where d you go
They re all out without you
Havin fun
Where d you go
Everyone left you
Nobody likes you
Where d you go
They re all out without you
Havin fun
Where d you go
Part IV Rock And Roll Girlfriend
Jeez ha
I got a rock and roll band
I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
And another ex wife
I got a rock and roll house
I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums
And I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York
I got a kid in the bay
I haven t drank or smoked nothin
In over 22 days
So get off my case
Off of my case
Off of my case
Part V We re Coming Home Again
HEY
Here they come marching down the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heartbeat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come and it s going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
Go carts and guns
are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat
The world is spinning
Round and round
Out of control again
From the 7 11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in hell
We re the ones going
Home
We re coming home again
Home
We re coming home again
I started fuckin running
As soon as my feet touched ground
We re back in barrio
And to you and me that s jingle town
That s home
We re coming home again
Home
We re coming home again
Home
We re coming home again
Home
We re coming home again
Home
We re coming home again
Home
We re coming home again
Home
We re coming home again
NO FUCKING CONTROL I NEED IT I KNOW
Home
We re coming home again
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They re all out without you
Havin fun
Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face
But I cant recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been
Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry ol Whatshisface
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face
But I cant recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been
Remember whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember whatever
It seems like forever ago
The regrets are useless
In my mind
She s in my head
I must confess
The regrets are useless
In my mind
She s in my head
From so long ago
Go go go
And in the darkest night
If my memory serves me right
I ll never turn back time
Forgetting you but not the time
By Japinha Freeman
3 AM I m drunk again
My head is standing underneath my puke
So make it stop I m getting off
Make it stop I m getting off
Sedatives and dizzy spells
And feeling like a salad in my puke
So make it stop I m getting off
Make it stop I m getting off
Well slipped into a coma once again
Where s my organ donor
Lend a hand
So when you think you re all alone
No one s left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate suffocate suffocate
One night stands and cheap regrets
I take another drag off of my cigarette
So stop I m getting off
Make it stop I m getting off
One last stop for one track mind
Just give me shelter give me give me something
Make it stop I m getting off
Make it stop I m getting off
Well slipped into a coma once again
Where s my organ donor
Lend a hand
So when you think you re all alone
No one s left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate suffocate suffocate
So when you think you re all alone
No one s left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate suffocate suffocate
Clenching my teeth tight
My head is like a sponge
Give it to me free
I wanna get ripped off
And drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck
On the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves
It all amuses me
For I ll be damned to spend my life in hell
Another wise ingrate
Bring me blood and pain
Of a stranger s fate
Give it all away
Give it to me now
I m desensitized
I wanna watch the bomb
Blow the masses high
I wanna get ripped off
And drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck
On the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves
It all amuses me
For I ll be damned to spend my life in hell
Another wise ingrate
Bring me blood and pain
Of a stranger s fate
Give it all away
I wanna get ripped off
And drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck
On the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves
It all amuses me
For I ll be damned to spend my life in hell
Another wise ingrate
You gotta problem you just can t hide
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath is taking up all the air
Your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head
Well reality is due
What you say just can t be true
When the story s stretched
And so far fetched
That you re lacking an excuse
You lied
Your mother allowed you just one white lie
But now she s dead and she left you with a problem
Pinnochio has pierced your tongue
Your nose is growing into the third dimension
Well reality is due
What you say just can t be true
When the story s stretched
And so far fetched
That you re lacking an excuse
You lied
Oh you lied
Well reality is due
What you say just can t be true
When the story s stretched
And so far fetched
That you re lacking an excuse
You lied

Tumors in my head
Whisper are you dying in my ear
Black rose of death
In my fist I clutch
Thorns shred my finger tips
And drips toxic blood
Kiss me one last time
Wipe off my sweat
Whisper are you dying in my ear
As my bones they rust
20 pounds of trust
Whisper are you dying in my ear
Black rose of death
In my fist I clutch
Thorns shred my finger tips
And drips toxic blood
I m rotting inside
My flesh turns to dust
Whisper are you dying in my ear
Kiss me one last time
Wipe off my sweat
Whisper are you dying in my ear
Whisper are you dying in my ear
Don t want to have you hangin
Around me like a leech
I think you re just a problem
So stay the hell away from me
because I don t believe in you
And I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Don t wanna fall in love
Don t need security
I ain t no dog without a bone
Don t have no time for love
So stay the fuck away from me
because I don t believe in you
And I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Don t wanna fall in love
This may sound a little rough
Don t wanna fall in love
This may sound a little rough
Don t wanna fall in love
This may sound a little fucked
Don t wanna fall in love

Why can t you just admit it you ve had it you re
Sick of me

Sick of me
Lost regrets and you say that your mad at me
Sick of me

And you ll leaving in a couple days
You re gonna change the world someday
Scumbag with a vision
It must be nice to know you got it all figured out
From the wear of sin
It s the same thing again and again
Have you ever stopped and thinked
before you opened up your mouth
Beacuase everytime you do
It s the same thing again and again
Sometimes it gets real hard
And I need some kind of output
For input twice the size of my one inch mind
So slap me on the hand
Put it right back down my pants
Turn me right around
Kick me in the ass
Well today I say sweet things
But tomorrow
I ll be making up excuses
For my actions cuz it s been so long
Since I ve been in love
That special kind of feeling
Guess my best excuse
I m on the wagon again
repeat
Well I got no real excuse
I m on the wagon again

She smashed the radio with the board of education
Turn up the static left of the state of the nation
Turn up the flame step on the gass
Burning the flag at half mast
She s a rebel s forgotten son
An expert of the revolution
She is the first voice of the last ones in the line
She ll drag the lake to keep the vendetta alive
Bring in the head of the government
The dog ate the document
Somebody shot the president
And no one knows where Maria went
Maria Maria Maria
where did you go
Be careful what you re offering
Your breath lacks the conviction
Drawing the line in the dirt
Because the last decision
is no
She smashed the radio with the board of education
Turn up the static left of the state of the nation
Turn up the flame step on the gass
Burning the flag at half mast
She s a rebel s forgotten son
An expert of the revolution
Maria Maria Maria
where did you go
Maria Maria Maria
where did you go
How do you get your sleep at night
How did you get your noose so tight
Like chewing on tin foil it s so much fun
Gonna be dead before your gone
Your telling names that ve got it
And I ll be happy till I won t be dead
And I ll pretend that your going down
And I ll be laughing I ll be laughing
How many feelings can you steal
Gonna be part of your appeal
I can see through you cause your wearing thin
Like chewing on tin foil once again
Your telling names that ve got it
And I ll be happy till I won t be dead
And I ll pretend that your going down
And I ll be laughing
Ha ha your re dead
And I m so happy
In loving memory
Of your demise
When your ship is going down
I ll go out and break the town
Ha ha you re dead
Ha ha you re dead
Ha ha you re dead
Ha ha ha
Ha ha you re dead
And I m so happy
In loving memory
Of your demise
When your ship is going down
I ll go out and break the town
Ha ha you re dead
Ha ha you re dead
Ha ha you re dead
Ha ha you re dead
The joke is over
You were an asshole
And now your gone
As your ship is going down
I ll stand by and watch you drown
Ha ha you re dead
Ha ha you re dead
Ha ha you re dead
Ha ha you re dead your gonna be dead
Just remember what I said
Ha ha you re dead

Dear mother can you hear me whining
It s been three whole weeks since that
I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I m feeling so alone
Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland
I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I m still here
For some strange reason it s now
Feeling like my home
And I m never gonna go
Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland
I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
Dear mother can you hear me laughing
It s been six whole months since that
I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I m still here
For some strange reason it s now
Feeling like my home
And I m never gonna go
Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland
I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
Somebody keep my balance
I think I m falling off
Into a state of regression
The expiration date
Rapidly coming up
It s leaving me behind to rank
Always move forward
Going straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
I m taking one step sideways
Leading with my crutch
Got a freaked up equilibrium
Count down from 9 to 5
Hooray We re gonna die
Blessed into our extinction
Always move forward
Going straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
Always move forward
Going straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
Do as I say not as I do because
The shit so deep you can t run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
I agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet s fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I ll hit you again
I m a smartass but I m playing dumb
Standards set and broken all the time
Control the chaos behind a gun
Call it as I see it even if
I was born deaf blind and dumb
Losers winning big on the lottery
Rehab rejects still sniffing glue
Constant refutation with myself
I m a vicitm of a catch 22
I have no belief
But I believe
I m a walking contradiction
And I ain t got no right
Do as I say not as I do because
The shit so deep you can t run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
I agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet s fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I ll hit you again
I m a smartass but I m playing dumb
I have no belief
But I believe
I m a walking contradiction
And I ain t got no right
I have no belief
But I believe
I m a walking contradiction
And I ain t got no right
Today s the Macy s Day parade
The night of the living dead is on it s way
With a credit report for duty call
It s a lifetime guarantee
Stuffed in a coffin 10 more free
Red light special at the mausoleum
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed to you
What s the consolation prize
Economy sized dreams of hope
When I was a kid I thought
I wanted all the things that I haven t got
Oh but I learned the hardest way
Then I realized what it took
To tell the difference between thieves and crooks
A lesson learned to me and you
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Cuz I m thinkin about a brand new hope
The one I ve never known
Cuz now I know it s all that I wanted
What s the consolation prize
Economy sized dreams of hope
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Cuz I m thinkin about a brand new hope
The one I ve never known
And where it goes
And I m thinkin about the only road
The one I ve never known
And where it goes
And I m thinkin about a brand new hope
The one I ve never known
Cuz now I know it s all that I wanted
We re living in repetition
Content in the same old shtick again
Now the routine s turning to contention
Like a production line going over and over and over
Roller coaster
Now I cannot speak I lost my voice
I m speechless and redundant
Cause I love you s not enough
I m lost for words
Choreographed and lack of passion
Prototypes of what we were
Went full circle til I m nauseous
Taken for granted now
Now I waste it I faked it I ate it now I hate it
Cause I cannot speak I lost my voice
I m speechless and redundant
Cause I love you s not enough
I m lost for words
Now I cannot speak I lost my voice
I m speechless and redundant
Cause I love you s not enough
I m lost for words
I ve been waiting a long time
For this moment to come
I m destined for anything at all
Downtown lights will be shining
On me like a new diamond
Ring out under the midnight hour
Well no one can touch me now well
And i can t turn my back
It s too late ready or not at all
Well I m so much closer than
I have ever known Wake up
Dawning of a new era
Calling don t let it catch ya falling
Ready or not at all
Well so close
Enough to taste it
Almost I can embrace this feeling
On the tip of my tongue
Well I m so much closer than
I have ever known
Wake up Better thank your lucky stars
Say hey hey
Well I m so much closer than I have ever known
Wake up Better thank your lucky stars
Say hey hey
I ve been waiting a lifetime
For this moment to come
I m destined for anything at all
Dumbstruck colour me stupid
Good luck you re gonna need it
Where I m
Going if I get there at all
Wake up Better thank your lucky stars

Class structures waving colors
Bleeding from my throat
Not subservient to you I m just alright
Down classed by the powers that be
Give me loss of hope
Cast out Buried in a hole
Struck down forcing me to fall
Destroyed giving up the fight
Well I know I m not alright

If it s alright
Take it from my dignity
And waste it till it s dead
Throw me back into the gutter
Cause it s alright
Find another pleasure fucker
Drag them down to hell

Struck down forcing me to fall
Destroyed giving up the fight
Well I know I m not alright

Nice guys finish last
You re running out of gas
Your sympathy will get you left behind
Sometimes you re at your best
When you feel the worst
Do you feel washed up
Like piss going down the drain
Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I m insane
I m so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth and now the joke s on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy
Oh nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don t pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
Living on command
You re shaking lots of hands
You re kissing up and bleeding all your trust
Taking what you need
Bite the hand that feeds
You lose your memory
And you got your shame
Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I m insane
I m so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth and now the joke s on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy
Oh nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don t pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine x4
He s a victim of his own time
In his vintage suit and tie
He s a casualty dressed to the teeth
In the latest genocide
The new seasons come and go
At the dog and pony show
Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names
And follow the dress codes
What s in a name hey
She s a scented magazine
Looking sharp and living clean
Living well and dressed to kill
But she looks like hell to me
So when you re dancing through the wardrobe
Do the anorex a go go
Cloaked with style
For pedophiles as the credit card explodes
You auctioned off your life
For the most expensive price
Going once
Going twice
Now it s gone
youth crew
You auctioned off your life
For the most expensive price
Going once
Going twice
Now it s gone
What s in a name hey
What s in a name hey
What s in a name
Waiting in a room
All dressed up and bound and gagged
Up to a chair it s so unfair
I don t dare move for the pain
She puts me through is what I need
So make it bleed
I m in distress oh mistress
I confess so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight
Well you know I will obey so please
Don t make me beg
For blood sex and booze you give me
Some say I m disturbed
But it s what I deserve another lesson
To be learned from a girl called kill
My head is in the gutter
Thank you sir strike up another mandolin
Of discipline
Throw me to the dogs
Let them eat my flesh down
To the wood
It feels so good
Oh I m in distress oh mistress
I confess so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight
Well you know I will obey
So please don t make me pay
For blood sex and booze you give me
Say I m disturbed
It s what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned from a girl called kill
Oh I m in distress oh mistress
I confess so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight
Well you know I will obey so please
Don t make me beg
For blood sex and booze you give me ahh
Today is the first day of the rest of our lives
Tomorrow is too late to pretend
Everything s all right
I m not getting any younger as long
As you dont get any older
I m not going to state that yesterday never was
Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep
Making you mascara bleed
Tears down your face
Leaving traces of my mistakes
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night
If you live with me I ll die for you
And this compromise
I hereby solemny swear to tell
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth is what
I ll ever hear from you
Trust is a dirty word that comes
Only from such a liar
But respect is something I will earn
If you have faith
Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep
Making you mascara bleed
Tears down your face
Leaving traces of my mistakes
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night
If you live with me I ll die for you
And this compromise
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night
If you live with me I ll die for you
And this compromise
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night
If you live with me I ll die for you
And this compromise
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night
If you live with me I ll die for you
And this compromise
And this compromise
So compromise
I m on a sentimental journey
Into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the
War that s in my mind
Leaving in the lurch
And I m taking back what s mine
I m on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
In the desolation road
where I m a
Castaway going at it alone
Castaway now I m on my own
Castaway going at it alone
Castaway now I m on my own
Lost and found trouble bound
Castaway
I m riding on a night train and
Driving stolen cars
Testing my nerves out on the boulevard
Spontaneous combustion in the
Corners of my mind
Leaving in the lurch
And I m taking back what s mine
I m on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
In the desolation road
Where I m a
Castaway going at it alone
Castaway now I m on my own
Castaway going at it alone
Castaway now I m on my own
Lost and found trouble bound
Castaway
I m on a sentimental journey
Into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the
War that s in my mind
Leaving in the lurch
And I m taking back what s mine
I m on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
In the desolation road
Where I m a
Castaway going at it alone
Castaway now I m on my own
Castaway going at it alone
Castaway now I m on my own
Lost and found trouble bound
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Wake up The house is on fire
And the cat s caught in the dryer
Philosophy s a liar when
Your home is your headstone
Icon is the last chance for hope
When there s no such thing as heroes
Your faith lies in the ditch that
You dug yourself in
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down
Deadbeat Holiday celebrate your own decay
There s a vacant sign that s hanging high
On a noose over your home
Deadbeat Holiday get on your knees and pray
There s a vacant sign that s hanging high
But at least you re not alone
Christmas lights in the middle of August
Grudges come back to haunt us
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
Grounded in a duplex to find that
You re living on a landmine
Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down
Deadbeat Holiday celebrate your own decay
There s a vacant sign that s hanging high
On a noose over your home
Deadbeat Holiday get on your knees and pray
There s a vacant sign that s hanging high
But at least you re not alone
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when all you
Want to do is not to give up
Deadbeat Holiday celebrate your own decay
There s a vacant sign that s hanging high
On a noose over your home
Deadbeat Holiday get on your knees and pray
There s a vacant sign that s hanging high
But at least you re not alone
Deadbeat Holiday celebrate your own decay
There s a vacant sign that s hanging high
On a noose over your home
I was a young boy that had big plans
Now I m just another shitty old man
I don t have fun and I hate everything
This world owes me so fuck you
Glory days don t mean shit to me
I drank a six pack of apathy
Life s a bitch and so am I
The world owes me so fuck you
Wasted youth and a fistful of ideas
I had a young and optimistic point of view
Wasted youth and a fistful of ideas
I had a young and optimistic point of view
I ve decomposed yet my gut s getting fat
Oh my God I m turning out like my Dad
I m always rude I ve a bad attitude
The world owes me so fuck you
The wife s a nag and the kids fucking up
I don t have sex cause I can t get it up
I m just a grouch sitting on the couch
The world owes me so fuck you
To know you is to hate you
So loving you must be like suicide
I don t mind if you don t mind
I m not the one that s going to die
I guess I just can t listen
To this one sided conversation again
cause I don t care if I don t care
No one ever said that life is fair
Everybody loves a joke
But no one likes a fool
And you re always cracking the same old lines again
You re well rehearsed on every verse
And that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity
The center of attention
Got an honorable mention once again
Congratulations and salutations
You re a figment of your own imagination
Everybody loves a joke
But no one likes a fool
And you re always cracking the same old lines again
You re well rehearsed on every verse
And that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity
To know you is to bait you
And you fell victim to your own denial
I don t mind if you don t mind
If you re wasting all your time
Well I ve got some scattered pictures
lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here
Now it seems I ve forgotten my purpose in this life
All the songs have been erased
Guess I ve learned from my mistakes well
Open the past and present now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future too
It s all I ve got and I m giving it to you
Well loose ends tied in knots
leaving a lump down in my throat
Gagging on a souvenir
Lodged to fill another year
Drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds
Leaving my self open wide
Living out a sacrifice
Open the past and present now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future too
It s all I ve got and I m giving it to you
If you got no one and I got no place to go
Would it be alright Could it be alright
I ve got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we shared
Makes me wish that you were here
Now it seems I ve forgotten my purpose in this life
All the songs have been erased
Guess I ve learned from my mistakes well
Open the past and present now and we are there
Story to tell and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future too
It s all I ve got and I m giving it to you
It s all I ve got and I m giving it to you
As I step to the edge
On the shadow of a doubt
With my conscience beating
Like the pulse of a drum
That hammers on and on
Until I reach the break of the day
When the sun beats down
on halfway house
as my conscience beating
The sound in my ear
The will to perserve
As I reach the break of the day
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskates losers
Nothing s left to cling onto
You got to hold on to yourself
A cry of hope
A plea for peace
And my conscience beating
It s not what I want for
It s all that I need
To reach the break of the Day
So I run to the edge
On the shadows of a doubt
With my conscience bleeding
Here lies the truth
The lost treasures of my youth
As I hold to the break of the day
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskates losers
Nothing s left to cling onto
You got to hold on to yourself
When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskates losers
Nothing s left to cling onto
You got to hold on to yourself
Virginia was a lot lizard from F L A
She had a compound fracture in the trunk
It started when she ran away
Thumbs out on the interstate
She hitched a ride to misery
Mr Whirly had a catastrophic incident
He fell into the city by the bay
He liquidated his estate
Now he sleeps upon the Haight
Panhandling misery
He s gonna get high high high
When he s low low low
The fire burns out from better days
And she screams why oh why
I say I don t know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery
Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam
He ran the drug cartel in tinseltown
They found him in a cadillac
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat in the name
Of misery
Gina hit the road to New York City
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked
She stopped in Vegas to elope
With Virginia and the dope
And kissed the bride eternally
And they re gonna get high high high
When they re low low low
The fire burns from better days
And he screamed why oh why
I said I don t know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery
Hell hounds on your trail now once again boy
It s groping on your leg until it sleeps
The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow
Because it s not what you make it s what you leave
And we re gonna get high high high
When I m low low low
The fire burns from better days
And she screamed why oh why
I said i don t know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery
All the time
Everytime I need it
What s the time
I d say the time is right
Here s to me
Let s find another reason
Down the hatch
And a bad attitude salud
Wasting time
wasting time down a bum fuck road
And I don t know where the hell it ll go
Heirlooms and huffing fumes
I m picking up the pace
And I m gonna smash it straight into a wall
All the time
A New Year s Resolution
How soon that we forget loving every minute
Live it up on another let down salud
Promises promises it was all set in stone
Cross my heart and hope to die
Sugar fix dirty tricks and a trick question
Guess I should have read between the lines
Having the time of my life
Watching the clock tick
Having the time of my life
Watching the clock tick
All the time
Where did all the time go
It s too late to say goodnight
Time flies when you re having fun
Times up when you work like a dog salud
Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone
The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride
A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall
Where do we go from here
And what did you do with directions
Promise me no dead end streets
And I ll guarantee we ll have the road
Come together like a foot in a shoe
Only this time I think I stuck my foot in my mouth
Thinking out loud and acting in vain
Knocking over anyone that stands in my way
Sometimes I need to apologize
Sometimes I need to admit that I ain t right
Sometimes I should just keep my mouth shut
or only say hello
Sometimes I still feel I m walking alone
Walk on eggshells on my old stomping ground
Yet there s really no one left that s hanging around
Isn t that another familiar face
Too drunk to figure out they re fading away
I fucked up again it s all my fault
So turn me around and face the wall
Read me my rights and tell me I m wrong
Until it gets into my thick skull
A slap on the wrist
A stab in the back
Torture me I ve been a bad boy
Nail me to the cross until you have won
I lost before I did any wrong
I m hexed with regrets and bad luck
Keep you distance cause it s rubbing off
Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell
Or earth with me tangled at your feet
You finally met you nemesis disguised as your fatal long lost love
So kiss it good bye
Until death do we part
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud
Haushinka is a girl with a peculiar name
I met her on the eve of my birthday
Did she know did she know before she went away
Does she know Does she know But it s too damn late
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
Now she s gone now she s gone she s all gone
All I have now is a memory to date
A cheap hat and cigarettes and a peculiar name
I didn t know I didn t know before she went away
I know now I know now and it s too damn late
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
Now she s gone now she s gone she s all gone
Will she ever find her way
I m too damn young to be too late but am I
Yet again I m kicking myself
And I ll be here in battle scars
Waiting for you Waiting for you now
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
This girl has gone far away now she s gone
Now she s gone now she s gone she s all gone
instrumental
Who the hell are you to tell me
What I am and what s my master plan
What makes you think that it includes you
Self righteous wealth
Stop flattering yourself
So when the smoke clears here I am
Your reject all American
Sucking up to your social sect
Making you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again I ve gone
You re not my type
Not my type
What s the difference between you and me
I do what I want and you do what you re told
So listen up shut the hell up
It s no big deal
And I ll see you in hell
So when the smoke clears here I am
Your reject all American
Sucking up to your social sect
Making you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again I ve gone
You re not my type
Not my type
Not my type
Your not my type
So when the smoke clears here I am
Your reject all American
Falling from grace right on my face
To hell and back and hell again I ve gone
You pushed me once too far again
I d like to break your fucking teeth
Stick a knife in the center of your back
You better grow some eyes in the back of your head
I fight dirty just like your looks
Can t take take take take take take anymore
Take back take back take
The taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue
An eye for an eye
Gun for a gun
Cold cocked and I m taking back what s mine
Expect it when you re least expecting it
No loss of love the smell of regret
Lights out can t take anymore
Take back take back take back take back
Shit
Your rise and fall back up against the wall
What goes around is coming back and haunting you
It s time to quit cause you ain t worth the shit
Under my shoes or the piss on the ground
No one loves you and you know it
Don t pretend that you enjoy it or you don t care
Cause now I wouldn t lie or tell you all the things you wanna hear
Cause I hate you x4
I heard you re sick sucked on that cancer stick
A throbbing tumor and a radiation high
Shit out of luck and now your time is up
It brings me pleasure just to know your gonna die
No one loves you and you know it
Don t pretend that you enjoy it or you don t care
Cause now I wouldn t lie or tell you all the things you wanna hear
Cause I hate you
Dickhead fuckface
Cock smoking mother fucking asshole
Dirty twat waste of semen
I hope you die
Red eye code blue I d like to strangle you
And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull
When you go down head first into the ground
I ll stand above you just to piss on your grave
No one loves you and you know it
Don t pretend that you enjoy it or you don t care
Cause now I wouldn t lie or tell you all the things you wanna hear
Cause I hate you

I woke up on the wrong side of the floor
Made made my way throgh the front door
Broke my engagement with myself
Perfect picture of bad health
another notch acratched on my bell
The future just ain ´ t what it used to be
I got a new start on a dead end road Peaked
Peaked out on reaching new lows
Owe I pald off all my debts to myself
Perfect picture of bad health
another notch acratched on my bell
The future ´ s In my living room
Uptight I ´ m a nag with a gun
All night suicide ´ s last call
I ´ ve been upting all night
I ´ m a son of gun
Uptight a nag with a gun
I see you down on the front line
Such a sight for sore eyes you re a suicide makeover
Plastic eyes lookin through a numbskull
Self effaced what s his face
You erased yourself so shut up
You don t let up
You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in the neck
You can smell it but you can t see it
No explanation identified cause you don t know
You don t say
And you got no reply
Hey you where did you come from
Got a head full of lead
you re a inbred bastard son
All dressed up red blooded A mannequin
Do or die no reply don t deny that you re synthetic
You re pathetic
You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in the neck
You can smell it but you can t see it
No explanantion identified cause you don t know
You don t say
And you got no reply
You don t know You don t say
And you got no reply
I see you down on the front line
such a sight for sore eyes you re a suicide makeover
You don t know You don t say
And you got no reply
You don t know You don t say
And you got no reply
Started at the age of four
My mother went to the grocery store
Went sneaking through her bedroom door
To find something in a size four
Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn t made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is making room
For the one and only
King for a day princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day princess by dawn
Just wait til all the guys get a load of me
My daddy threw me in therapy
He thinks I m not a real man
Who put the drag in the drag queen
Don t knock it until you tried it
Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn t made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is making room
For the one and only
King for a day princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong

Mom and Dad don t look so hot these days
They re getting over the hill
Death is closing in and catching up
As far as I can tell
Got a plan of action and cold blood
And it smells of defiance
I ll just wait for Mom and Dad to die
And my inheritance
Well now I want more
Cause I m getting bored
And I m going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
But it s all figured out
Well nothing good can last
Crows feet and rot are setting in
And time is running out
My parent s income interest rate
Is gaining higher clout
I m a snot nosed slob
Without a job
And I know I damn well should
Mom and Dad don t look so hot these days
But my future s looking good
Well now I want more
Cause I m getting bored
And I m going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
But it s all figured out
Well nothing good can last
Well now I want more
Cause I m getting bored
And I m going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
But it s all figured out
Well nothing good can last
Stranded lost inside myself
My own worst friend
And my own closest enemy
I m branded Maladjusted
Never trusted anyone
Let alone myself
I must insist
On being a pessimist
I m a loner in a catastrophic mind
Elected the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot
No meaning And no healing
Self loathing freak and introverted
Deviot
I must insist
On being a pessimist
I m a loner in a catastrophic mind
Stranded lost inside myself
My own worst friend
And my own closest enemy
Elected the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot
I must insist
On being a pessimist
I m a loner in a catastrophic mind
I m getting pissed
I m a worthless pessimist
I m a loner in a claustrophobic mind
I ve got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high
I lose control and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall
I self destruct and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up
Bother myself and I m all wound up
Little reserve and I m all wound up
Loss of control and I m all wound up
All by myself and I m all wound up
Chip on my shoulder and a leech on my back
Stuck in a rut and I get myself all wound up
Killed my composure and it will never come back
Loss of control and I get myself all wound up
Blown out of proportion again
My temper snaps and I get myself all wound up
Spontaneous combustion
Panic attack
I slipped a gear and I get myself all wound up
I lose myself and I m all wound up
Bother myself and I m all wound up
I like myself and I m all wound up
I like myself and I m all wound up
I ve got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high
I lose control and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall
I self destruct and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up
Bother myself and I m all wound up
Loss of control and I m all wound up
Panic attack and I m all wound up
Bother myself and I m all wound up
Oh well I am just a mutt
And nowhere is my home
Where dignity s a land mine
In the school of lost hope
I ve panhandled for life because
I m not afraid to beg
Hand me down your lost and founds
Of second hand regret
You better swallow your pride
Or you re gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honor s gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I m not the one
I got no pride
Sects of disconnection
And traditions of lost faith
No culture s worth a stream of piss
Or bullet in my face
To hell with unity
Separation ll kill us all
Torn to shreds and disjointed
Before the final fall
You better swallow your pride
Or you re gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honor s gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I m not the one
I got no pride
You better swallow your pride
Or you re gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honor s gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I m not the one
I got no pride
I got no pride
Close your eyes and die
I got no pride
What brings you around
Did you lose something the last time you were here
You ll never find it now
It s buried deep with your identity
So stand aside and let the next one pass
Don t let the door kick you in the ass
There s no return from 86 4x
Don t even try
Exit out the back
And never show your head around again
Purchase your ticket
And quickly take the last train
Out of town
So stand aside and let the next one pass
Don t let the door kick you in the ass
There s no return from 86 4x
Don t even try
There s no return from 86 4x
Don t even try
Ready for a cheap escape
On the brink of self destruction
Widespread panic
Broken glass inside my head
Bleeding down these thoughts of
Anguish mass confusion
Well the world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shit
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with I don t care
There s a plague inside of me
Eating at my disposition
Nothing s left
Torn out of reality
Into a state of no opinion
Limp with hate
Well the world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shit
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with I don t care
I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
Standing on the corner of
Stuart and the Avenue
Ripping up my transfer
And a photograph of you
You re a blur of my dead past and rotting existence
As I stand laughing on the corner of insignificance
Destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it s all fucked up
Seasons change as well as minds
And I m a two faced clown
You re mommy s little nightmare
Driving daddy s car around
I m beat down and half brain dead
The long lost king of fools
I may be dumb
But I m not stupid enough to stay with you
Well destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it s all fucked up
Well destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before it might have made some sense
But now it s all fucked up
You re all fucked up
You re all fucked up
Boxed up all her favorite things
Sold the rest at a rainy yard sale
Big plans and leaving friends
And a westbound sign
Weighed out her choices on a scale prevailing
Nothing made sense
Just transportation and a blank decision
She s taking off
No time and no copping out
She s burning daylight and petrol
Blacked out the rearview mirror
Heading westward on
Strung out on confusion road
And ten minute nervous breakdowns
Xanex a beer for thought and she determined
She s taking off
Is it salvation or an escape from discontent
Will she find her name in the california cement
Punched out of the grind that punched her one too many times
Is tragedy 2000 miles away
She s taking off
Cheapskate on the hill
A thrill seeker making deals
Sugar city urchin washing time
Town of lunatics
Begging for another fix
Turning tricks for speedballs
One more night
Making your rounds once again
Turning up emptyhanded
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn tight wad hill
Drugstore hooligan
Another white trash mannequin
On display to rot up on the hill
Living out a lie
But having the time of his life
Hating every minute of his existence
Making your rounds once again
Turning up emptyhanded
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn tight wad hill
Making your rounds once again
Turning up emptyhanded
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn tight wad hill
Something s on my mind
It s been for quite some time
This time I m on to you
So where s the other face
The face I heard before
Your head trip s boring me
Let s nuke the bridge we torched
2 000 times before
This time we ll blast it all to hell
I ve had this burning in my guts now
for so long
My belly s aching now to say
Stuck down in a rut of dislogic and smut
A side of you well hid
When it s all said and done
it s real and it s been fun
But was it all REAL fun
Let s nuke this bridge we torched
2 000 times before
This time we ll blast it all to hell
I ve had this burning in my guts now
for so long
My belly s aching now to say
You re just a fuck
I can t explain it cause I think you suck
I m taking pride
In telling you to Fuck Off and Die
I ve had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly s aching now to sing
I m taking pleasure in passing these doubts to you
So listen up cause you might miss
You re just a fuck
I can t explain it cause I think you suck
I m taking pride
In telling you to Fuck Off and Die
Good night
Roaming round your house
Wasting your time
No obligation just
Wasting your time
So why are you alone
Wasting your time
When you could be with me
Wasting your time
I m a waste like you
With nothing else to do
May I waste your time too
Warding off regrets
Wasting your time
Smoking cigarettes
Wasting your time
I m just a parasite
Wasting your time
Applying myself to
Wasting your time
I m a waste like you
With nothing else to do
May I waste your time too
So why are you alone
Wasting your time
When you could be with me
Wasting your time
I m a waste like you
With nothing else to do
May I waste your time too
I saw my friend the other day and I don t know
Exactly just what he became
It goes to show
It wasn t long ago
I was just like you
And now I think I m sick and I wanna go home
How have I been how have you been
It s been so long
What have you done with all your time
And what went wrong
I knew you back when
And you you knew me
And now I think I m sick and I wanna go home
Anybody ever say no
Ever tell you that you weren t right
Where did all the little kid go
Did you lose it in a hateful fight
And you know it s true
It wasn t long ago
I was just like you
And now I think I m sick and I wanna go home
I m all busted up
Broken bones nasty cuts
Accidents will happen
But this time I can t get up
She comes to check on me
Making sure I m on my knees
After all she s the one who put me in this state
Is she ultra violent
Is she disturbed
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh god she s killing me
For now I ll lie around
Hell that s all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true
Is she ultra violent
Is she disturbed
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh god she s killing me
Looking out my window for
Someone that s passing by
No one knows I m locked in here
All I do is cry
For now I ll lie around
Hell that s all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true
All brawn and no brains
And all those nice things
You FINALLY got what you want
Someone to look good with
AND light your cigarette
Is this what you really want
I figured out what you re all about
And I don t think I like what I see
SOOOOO
I HOPE I won t be there in the end
If you come around
How long will he last
Before he s a CREEP in the past
And you re alone once again
Will you pop up AGAIN and be my
SPECIAL FRIEND till the end
And when will that be
I figured out what you re all about
And I don t think I like what I see
SOOOOO
I HOPE I won t be there in the end
If you come around
I figured out what you re all about
And I don t think I like what I see
SOOOOO
I HOPE I won t be there in the end
If you come around
I m taking all you down with me
Explosive duct taped to my spine
Nothing s gonna change my mind
I won t listen to anyone s last words
There s nothing left for you to say
Soon you ll be dead anyway
Well no one here is getting out alive
This time I ve really lost my mind and I don t care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent
And what they ve meant
To me it s nothing several x
I m losing all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on my
Loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
I m taking it all out on you
And all the shit you put me through
So no one here is getting out alive
This time I ve lost my mind and I don t care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times
You spent and what they ve meant
To me it s nothing several x
Do you ever think back to another time
Does it bring you so down
That you thought you lost your mind
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to nothing
To me it s nothing several x
I don t know you
But I think I HATE you
You re the reason for my misery
Strange now you ve become my biggest enemy
And I ve never even seen your face
Maybe it s just jealousy
Mixing up with a VIOLENT mind
A circumstance that doesn t make much SENSE
Or maybe I m just DUMB
You re the cloud hanging out over my head
Hail comes crashing down welting my face
MAGIC MAN EGOCENTRIC PLASTIC MAN
Yet you still got one over on me
I was alone
I was all by myself
No one was looking
I was thinking of you
And yeah did I mention
I was all by myself
All by myself
All by myself
All by myself
All by myself
I went to your house
But no one was there
I went in your room
I was all by myself
You and me had
Such wonderful times
When I m all by myself
All by myself
I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I ve been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning
I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
Cause she s 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so
Never let go
Cause she s 2000 light years away
Years Away
I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Lookout as far as I can
I can t see her but in the distance
I hear some laughter
We laugh together
I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
Cause she s 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so
Never let go
Cause she s 2000 light years away
Years Away
I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I ve been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning
I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
Cause she s 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so
Never let go
Cause she s 2000 light years away
When I was younger I thought the world circled around me
But in time I realized I was wrong
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
It was a tragic case of my reality
Do you think you re indestructable
And no one can touch you
Well I think you re disposeable
And it s time you knew the truth
Cause it s just one of my lies
It s just one of my lies
I only wanted to get real high
Cause it s just one of my lies
Why does my life have to be so small
Yet death is forever
And does forever have a life to call its own
Don t give me an answer cause you only know as much as I know
Unless you re been there once
Well I hardly think so
I used to pray all night
Before I lay myself down
My mother said it was right
Her mother said it too
Why
Juliet s trying to find out what she wants
but she don t know
Experience has got her down
Well look this direction
I know it s not perfection it s just me
I want to bring you up again now
Cause I m losing what s left of my dignity
A small price I will pay to see that you re happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in
Juliet s crying cause now she s realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again somehow
I wanna be your Dominated Love Slave
Want to be the one that takes the Pain
You can spank me when I don ’ t behave
Mack me in the forehead with a chain
Cause I love feeling dirty
And I love feeling cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive those staples deep
I want you to slap me
Call me naughty
Put a beltsander against my skin
I Want to feel pain all over my body
Can ’ t wait to get punished for my sins
Cause I love feeling dirty
And I love feeling cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive those staples deep
And I love feeling dirty
And I love feeling cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive those staples
Hey old man in woman s shoes
I wonder if he knows I think he s crazy
When he was young did her have dreams
Of wearing woman s shoes and being crazy
It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging
for your spare change
Or will I grow that old
Will I still be around
The way I carry on I ll end up
Six feet underground
And waste away
When the old man was in school
Did the golden rule make him go crazy
Or did he hide away from hopes
Behind a smile and smoking dope
It s crazy
It seems so frightening
Time passes by like lightning
Before you know it you re struck down
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around
I wonder down these streets all by myself
Think of my future now
I just don t know
I don t seem to care
I stop to notice that
I m by your home
I wonder if you re sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there
Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you re in my sight
And through my veins temptation flows
So I sit down here on the hard concrete
Think of my future now
I just don t know
I don t seem to care
So I sit across the street from your home
I wonder if you re sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there
My mental stability reaches its bitter end
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease someone called love
Not as long as there are girls like you
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I wanna hurt myself
If anyone can hear me slap some sense in me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall
Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
And lock myself up in a padded room
I d sit and spew my guts out to the open air
Cause no one wants to hear a drunken fool
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can t trust myself
If anyone can hear me slap some sense in me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall
I do not mind if this goes on
Cause now it seems I m too far gone
I must admit that I en joy myself
80 please keep taking me away
away
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can t trust myself
If anyone can hear me slap some sense in me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall
Staring out of my window
Watching the cars go rolling by
My friends are gone
I ve got nothing to do
So I sit here patiently
Watching the clock tick so slowly
Gotta get away
Or my brains will explode
Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road
See the hills from afar
Standing on my beat up car
The sun went down and the night fills the sky
Now I feel like me once again
As the train comes rolling in
Smoked my boredom gone
Slapped my brains up so high
Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
We ll always seem to find our way to Christie Road
If there s one thing that I need that makes me feel complete
So I go to Christie Road
It s home
Why should my fun have to end
For me it s only the beginning
I see my friends begin to age
A short countdown to there end
Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes
Better think again
Cause no one knows
I don t want to cause no harm
But sometimes my actions hurt
Is there something I should find
To make plans for forever
Does it seem like all your memories fade
You soak up knowledge to fill the space
And still my answer remains
I don t know
I ll go for miles
Till I find you
You say you want to leave me
But you can t choose
I ve gone thru pain
Every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane
Something I can t fight
Don t leave me
A blank expression
Covering your face
I m looking for directions
For out of this place
I start to wonder
If you ll come back
I feel the rain storming after thunder
I can t hold back
Come with me and let s go for a ride
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout
Cause I know that you re the
Best thing in town Best thing around
Best thing in town Best thing around
Running wild and always running free
Doing things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds
Now I know that you re the
Best thing in town Best thing around
Best thing in town Best thing around
I m seeing faces
Of mysterys of the earth
I am not one
To the aggersions of my birth
Or go to stance
Of houllinations
I can t find
A missing peice
Of a thought thats in my mind
Come with me and let s go for a ride
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout
Cause I know that you re the
Best thing in town Best thing around
Best thing in town Best thing around
Running wild and always running free
Doing things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds
Now I know that you re the
Best thing in town Best thing around
Best thing in town Best thing around
Now it seems I can t keep my mind of you
My brain drifts back to better days we ve been through
Like sitting on blacktop of the school grounds
The love I bitched about I finally found
But now it s gone and I take the blame
So there s nothing I can do but take the pain
Why
Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me I am blind without a cause
And now I reazlied what I have lost
It was something real that I could have had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul s gone bad
Why
Tell me the words I might have said
That s pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late
Just tell me the words I might have ate
Well people try to put us down
Talkin bout my generation
Just because we get around
Talkin bout my generation
The things they do look awful cold
Talkin bout my generation
I hope I die before I get old
Talkin bout my generation
My generation
Why don t you all just fade away
Talkin bout my generation
And don t try to dig what we all say
Talkin bout my generation
I m not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin bout my generation
I m just talkin bout my generation
Talkin bout my generation
My generation
Break it fuck that shit
Why don t you all just fade away
Talkin bout my generation
And don t try to dig what we all say
Talkin bout my generation
I m not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin bout my generation
I m just talkin bout my generation
Talkin bout my generation
My generation
Talkin bout my generation
This is my generation
This is my generation baby
Hey there lookin at me
Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don t have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit grey
Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon
I just need a little time
What is it that drives me mad
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore
What makes me feel so much pain
That makes me go so insane
What is it about you that I adore
Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon
I just need a little time
What time wooow
Why did you have to leave so soon
Why did you have to walk away
Oh well it happened again
She walked away with her boyfriend
Maybe we ll meet again someday
Maybe we ll meet again someday
Maybe we ll meet again someday
Someday
Looking at the clouds in the sky
floating image in my mind
Now I wonder where this place is from
Evidence is everywhere
I start to run now I m scared
Strange beings all around
Everyone come to this place I ve found
I m feeling phyced
walking wonder why
All my joys are open
No more crimes
My eyes are clear and now I m cured
I only wanna be for sure
Get in my mind and you will find
Mother love from all mankind
Looking back upon my life
And the places that I ´ ve been
Pictures faces girls I ´ ve loved
I try to remember when
Faded memories on the wall
Some names I have forgotten
But each one is a memory I
Look back on so often
I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
Looking back what I have done
There ´ s lots more life to live
At times I feel overwhelmed
I question what I can ´ t give
But I don ´ t let it get me down
Or cause me too much sorrow
There ´ s no doubt about who I am
I always have tomorrow
I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
Looking back upon my life all my life
Faded memories on the wall on the wall
Looking now at who I am who am I
I don ´ t let it get me down I don ´ t let it get me down
Now you see me now you don t
Don t ask me where I m at
Cause I m a million miles away
Treated like a forbidden heel
Don t say my thoughts are not for real
Or you won t see me again
Am I here or am I there
Or am I playing on the stairs
Am I in my room with my toys
I am the disappearing boy
When I walk in crowded rooms
I feel as if it is my doom
I know that I don t belong
In that room I see her
I see her and she s with him
I turn around and then I m gone
Don t call me up cause I m not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
I m the disappearing boy
I have my doubts
Of where I belong
It s something to think about
A small cloud has fallen the white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
Vegging on one detail the rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red
Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
Laying in my bed I think I m in left field
I picture someone I think it s you
You re standing so damn close my body begins to swell
Why does 1 and 1 make 2
Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
Laying in my bed I think I m in left field
I picture someone I think it s you
You re standing so damn close my body begins to swell
Why does 1 and 1 make 2
Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
See a young girl so soft and blonde
Doesn t attack me but she did once
Intoxications in her veins
Sweet young boy plays with her brain
Lydia ll bring to life
What are your chance not to oblige
Putting his hand on her thigh
Ability has now been ripped
Take it away I d rather sit
Sweet children sweet children sweet children
Remember when
Johnny s playing fun and games
or else he s in the storage shed
Running from the light of day
or maybe lie and celebrate
The funny circus from his head
Follow me if you understand
I ll trick her so she ll do it
Then I ll sing and now we run
Sweet children sweet children sweet children
Remember when
Sweet children sweet children sweet children
Remember when
I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I ll never do exactly what I want
And I ll sculpt my life for your acceptance
I feel forgotten
Feel like rotting
Do you feel the same
Adolescence
Just can t make sense
It s calling my name
I take a look around
And all the things I ve found
I call it blind hatred
If you d stop a while
And maybe if you d smile
You would realize that
We re all the same
It s just like our brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain
All my life I ve seemed to have this need
I think at times it even turns to greed
We all want to join some family
We ll even sacrifice a moral changing
Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now what does this mean
Are all these problems just in my mind
Things are easy when you re a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I ve gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair
Look at my friends and see what they ve done
Ask myself why they had to change
I like them better when they were young
Now all these times are rearranged
I look down and stand there and cry
Nothing ever will be the same
The sun is rising now I ask why
The clouds now fall and here comes the rain
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair
Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now what does this mean
Are all these problems just in my mind
Things are easy when you re a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I ve gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair
Hey can you hear me
I m calling your name
Hello Or is this goodbye
The gleam in your eyes
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again
So I can rest my head
Angel Dancing away
As all of my thoughts get rearranged
Angel Turning away
Just when thing seem
To have changed
So I can rest my head
Starlit night
The moon is shining bright
You re the one I need
Up at your window
I see a shadow
Silhouette of your grace
Here s this flower
I picked for all the hours
That you ve spent with me
The one I love
That I ve been dreaming of
Sailing across the sea
Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer a kiss we ll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We ll never break as one too strong
And nothing s more
Than what our love is for
As I kiss your cheek
Oh so softly
Hands flowing down my back
1 000 hours I ll never leave
Our romance
Is a love trance
And now we ll never part
1 000 hours
Of such a love shower
We ll never stop once we start
Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer a kiss we ll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We ll never break as one too strong
Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer a kiss we ll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We ll never break as one too strong
Princess in a school girl s dream
May I please speak with you
I m having troubles with control
And it s all because of you
Today I kept on falling down
I thought it was the street
So I look down at my shoes
They were on the wrong feet
I find it hard to be myself
Can you please explain
I do not think that it s my health
You re the one to blame
You re the one I wish I had
And now my girlfriend is getting mad
I cannot call this sane
Today as I was walking down
You bumped into me
You said excuse me and walked away
As I dropped to my knees
I prayed to the being in the sky
That my parents told me of
I asked about you but no reply
No clues about your love
My girlfriend left me on the phone
I m pathetically left here alone
I cannot call this sane
Can we find a way
So that you can stay
I think I m gonna Pop
I saw you standing alone
With a sad look on your face
You call him on the phone
Looks like he left you
Without a trace
Tears falling out of your eyes
He s living in a disguise
You ve been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it s right or wrong
Why do you want him x3
Now many days have gone by
And you still just sit there and cry
You re feeling bad for yourself
His memory will always dwell
You re so obsessed with his love
That s why push came to shove
You ve been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it s right or wrong
Why do you want him x3
I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted
In a daze
It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted
In my daze
And I m looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break through these chains
These chains that control
My future s aim
I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted
In a daze
Maybe I m just too damn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed to think that way
And all of your time gets wast
In my daze
And I m looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break through these chains
These chains that control
My future s aim
I m looking
Back now at
Where I have
Have gone wrong
And why I
Could not seem
Could not seem
To get along
And I m looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break through these chains
These chains that control
My future s aim
Now I rest my head from
Such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness
That had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems
As if I ll get some rest
But now and then I ll see you again
And it puts my heart to the test
So when are all my troubles going to end
I m understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I m asking why
I still think about you
As the days go on I wonder
Will this ever end
I find it hard to keep control
When you re with your boyfriend
I do not mind if all I am is
Just a friend to you
But all I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too
I wish I could tell you
But the words would come out wrong
Oh if you only knew
The way I ve felt for so long
I know that we re worlds apart
But I just don t seem to care
These feelings in my heart
Only with you I want to share
The first time I caught a glimpse of you
Then all my thoughts were only of you
I hope that when time goes by
You will think the same about me
Many nights awake I lie
I only wish that you could see
I know that we re only friends
I hope this feeling never ends
If I could only hold you
It s the only thing I want to do
I know that things are getting tougher
When you can t get the top off from the bottom of the barrel
Wide open road of my future now
It s looking fucking narrow
Chorus
All I know is that I don t know
All I know is that I don t know nothin
All I know is that I don t know
All I know is that I don t know nothin
We get told to decide
Just like as if I m not going to change my mind
Chorus
Whatcha gonna do with yourself
Boy better make up your own mind
Whatcha gonna do with yourself boy
You re running out of time
This time I got it all figured out
Chorus
All I know is that I don t know
All I know is that I don t know nothin
All I know is that I don t don t know
All I know is that I don t know nothin
And that s fine
Sitting in my room last night
Staring at the mirror
I couldn t find a reason why
I couldn t be near her
Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I m thinking
About the words you d say
Pictures going through my mind
When we re together
All these long and sleepless nights
Will I ever get better
Refrão
Because you are the one that I want 4x
Now you know how I feel
This love is forever
You make my life seem so unreal
Will I ever get better
Because you are the one that I want
Late last night I had a dream
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky
Flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she ll dry tears
Left on my face I ve cried
Oh I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend
I ll send a letter to that girl
Asking her to by my own
But my pen is writing wrong
So I ll say it in a song
Oh I love you more right now
More than I ve ever loved before
Here s those words straight from these lips
I ll need you forever more
Come ease the pain that s in my heart
Come ease the pain that s in my heart
Come ease the pain that s in my heart
Come ease the pain that s in my heart
I lock myself inside my room
I want to be alone
With you around you ll only add on
I want to be alone
It s been disturbed by my thoughts
I want to be alone
With you around you ll only add on
I want to be alone
Please don t think I m crazy
I don t want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy
To hell with your helping hand
Why don t you just leave me alone
This conflict is my own
Keep your sources away from me
That s all
