I m walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And I ll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
And I never saw you coming
And I ll never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real
And I never saw you coming
And I ll never be the same oh
And I never saw you coming
And I ll never be the same
So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
I bet this time of night you re still up
I bet you re tired from a long hard week
I bet you re sittin in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I bet
Sometimes you wonder bout me
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don t
I almost do
I almost do
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out there s no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you
That I can t say hello to you and risk another goodbye
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don t
I almost do I almost do
Oh we made quite a mess babe
It s probably better off this way
And I confess baby
In my dreams you re touching my face
And asking me if I d want to try again with you
And I almost do
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don t
I almost do I almost do
I bet this time of night you re still up
I bet you re tired from a long hard week
I bet you re sittin in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I hope
Sometimes you wonder bout me
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didn t care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me
And he s long gone when he s next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I d never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I d never been
Now I m lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh oh
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh oh
Trouble trouble trouble
No apologies he ll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn t know that he s the reason why
You re drowning you re drowning you re drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I ll ever be
And now I see now I see now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me hey
I knew you were trouble when you walked in Oh
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I d never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I d never been Yeah
Now I m lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh oh Yeah
Trouble trouble trouble Trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her or anyone or anything

So shame on me now

Til you put me down oh

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying This is it I ve had enough cause like
We hadn t seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space what
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear I m gonna change trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say I hate you we break up you call me I love you
Ooh we called it off again last night but
Ooh this time I m telling you I m telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Like ever
I m really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I m right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that s much cooler than mine
Ooh you called me up again tonight but
Ooh this time I m telling you I m telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say never say never
So he calls me up and he s like I still love you
And I m like I m just I mean this is exhausting you know
Like we are never getting back together
Like ever
No
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me

We
No
Getting back together

You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
Talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister s house
And you ve still got it in your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition
And my wide eyed gaze
We re singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it s long gone and that magic s not here no more
And I might be okay but I m not fine at all oh oh oh
Cause there we are again on that
Little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were
Looking over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother s telling stories
bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
And I know it s long gone
and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all too well
Time won t fly it s like I m paralyzed by it
I d like to be my old self again but I m still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights
when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can t get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you ve ever known
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
Down the stairs you were there you remember it all
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah ah ah ah
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah ah ah ah
Yeah we re happy free confused
and lonely at the same time
It s miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight s the night
when we forget about the deadlines it s time
Ah ah
I don t know about you
But I m feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don t know about me
But I ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we re
22
22
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids Who is Taylor Swift anyway
Ah ah ah ah
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping yeah
We re happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It s miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight s the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
it s time
Ah ah
I don t know about you
But I m feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don t know about me
But I ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if Alright

We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won t be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
I m pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That s when you came in wearing a football helmet and said Ok let s talk
And I said
Stay stay stay
I ve been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that it s funny when I m mad mad mad
But I think that it s best if we both stay
Before you I d only dated self indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I m always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
Stay stay stay
I ve been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that it s funny when I m mad mad mad
But I think that it s best if we both stay
Stay stay stay stay
You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn t leave
It s been occurring to me
I d like to hang out with you
For my whole life
Stay
And I ll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad
So I think that it s best if we both stay
Stay stay stay stay stay
Stay stay stay
I ve been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that it s funny when I m mad mad mad
But I think that it s best if we both stay
Stay stay stay stay stay
Stay stay stay
I ve been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that it s funny when I m mad mad mad
But I think that it s best if we both stay
That s so fun
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don t touch
Out of focus eye to eye
Till the gravity s too much
And I ll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I d be smart to walk away
But you re quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I like it
I can t decide if it s a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you re friction
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I I I like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I I I
I I I
I I I
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
This slope is treacherous
I I I like it
I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
And right before your eyes
I m breaking no past
No reasons why
Just you and me
This is the last time I m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye
You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better
And right before your eyes
I m aching
No past nowhere to hide
Just you and me
This is the last time I m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye
This is the last time you tell me I ve got it wrong
This is the last time I say it s been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time I won t hurt you anymore
Oh ho oh ho oh ho oh ho
Oh ho oh ho oh ho oh ho
This is the last time I m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time I m asking you this
This is the last time I m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I m asking you why
This is the last time I m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
You break my heart
This is the last time I m asking you last time I m asking you
Last time I m asking you this
This is the last time I m asking you last time I m asking you
Last time I m asking you this
This is the last time I m asking you last time I m asking you
Last time I m asking you this
This is the last time I m asking you last time I m asking you
Last time I m asking you this
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words how little they mean when you re a little too late
I stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
Good girls hopeful they ll be and long they will wait
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you ve got your demons
And darling they all look like me
Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair Whoa oh whoa oh
Distance timing breakdown fighting
Silence the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen
Hang up give up and for the life of us we can t get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic beautiful tragic beautiful
What we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
down a dead end street
Faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying
to change your mind once you re already flying
through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn so bright
just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I d never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know
somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
But loving him was red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted
was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword
and realizing there s no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I d never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone Woah
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Red red red
Red red red
Oh red Red red red
Red red red
Burning red Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it s time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red
Oh losing him was blue like I d never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone Woah
Forgetting him was like
trying to know somebody you never met
Cause loving him was red
Red red red red red red
Yeah yeah red
Red red red red red red
Burning red Red red red red red red
Red red red red red red
And that s why he s spinning round in my head
Red red red red red red
Comes back to me Red red red red red red
burning red
Red red red red red red Yeah yeah
Red red red red red red
His love was like driving a new Maserati
down a dead end street
You should ve been there
Should ve burst through the door
With that Baby I m right here smile
And it would ve felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would ve been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I ve got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I ve been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you d be here
You said you d be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they re all laughing
As I m looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there s something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said he d be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they re all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing Missing
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn t show
You should ve been here
And I would ve been so happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they re all standing around me singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I knew
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You called me later
And said I m sorry I didn t make it
And I said I m sorry too
And that was the moment I knew
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
And Lord it took me away
Back to a first glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light go
Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we d made
And that was the first day
And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of I need you
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story s got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
Cause darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight I m gonna dance
For all that we ve been through
But I don t wanna dance
If I m not dancing with you
Tonight I m gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don t wanna dance
If I m not dancing with you
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight I m gonna dance
For all that we ve been through
But I don t wanna dance
If I m not dancing with you
Tonight I m gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don t wanna dance
If I m not dancing with you
New to town with a made up name
In the angel s city chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
And they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
Yeah they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
But can you tell me now you re the lucky one
Oh oh oh
Now it s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you re lucky but you re so confused
Cause you don t feel pretty you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you ll make it out alive
And they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
Yeah they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
But can you tell me now you re the lucky one
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now
Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
Let me tell you now you re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you re the lucky one oh oh oh
Yeah they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
Yeah they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you re the lucky one oh oh oh
Oh oh whoa oh oh
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now know something now
I didn t before
And all I ve seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like
I just want to know you better know you better
know you better now
I just want to know you better know you better
know you better now
I just want to know you better know you better
know you better now

And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You ll be mine and I ll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
But I ll take ‘ em down take ‘ em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies the beautiful kind
Makin up for lost time takin flight making me feel like
I just want to know you better know you better

And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it s not all in my mind
I just want to know you better know you better

Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed

All I know since yesterday

All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a newfound grace
All my days I ll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
Come on baby with me
We re going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming Why
Flowers pile up in the worst way no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it s about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear
Come on baby with me
We re going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
we ll just disappear
Come on baby with me
We re going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
What if I m standing in your closet trying to talk to you
And what if I kept the hand me downs you won t grow into
And what if I really thought some miracle
would see us through
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you
Come on baby with me
We re going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me
We re going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn t like it when I wore high heels but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn t get this song but I do I do
I walked in expecting you d be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don t know how nice that is but I do
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it s strange that you think I m funny cause he never did
I ve been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you but I do
We tell stories and you don t know why
I m coming off a little shy but I do
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it s strange that you think I m funny cause he never did
I ve been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time what s past is past
Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it s strange that you think I m funny cause he never did
I ve been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again
You said it in a simple way
4 AM the second day
How strange that I don t know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself don t get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don t wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess you re in New York today
I don t wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would ve played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can t help but wish you took me with you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don t wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess you re in London today
And I don t wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
This is falling in love in the cruellest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York be here
But you re in London and I break down
Cause it s not fair that you re not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don t wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess you re in New York today
And I don t wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
Oh oh oh oh
I don t wanna miss you like this
Oh oh oh oh
Come back be here
Come back be here
I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we re made of starlight
Like we re made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window we were seventeen and crazy running wild wild
Can t remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Like we re made of starlight starlight
He said Look at you
worrying too much about things you can t change
You ll spend your whole life singing the blues
if you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Don t you see the starlight starlight
Don t you dream impossible things
Like Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Ooh ooh he s talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach em how to dream
Ooh hoo hoo
Ooh hoo hoo
Ooh hoo hoo
Ooh hoo hoo
Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight starlight Ooh hoo hoo
Like we dream impossible dreams Ooh hoo hoo
Don t you see the starlight starlight Ooh hoo hoo
Don t you dream impossible things
They tell you while you re young
Girls go out and have your fun
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you re soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say She looks like she s been through it
Lord what will become of me
Once I ve lost my novelty
I ve had too much to drink tonight
And I know it s sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It s like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty two
And will you still want me when I m nothing new
How long will it be cute all this crying in my room
When you can t blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room
People love an ingénue
I ve had too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It s like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty two
And will you still want me when I m nothing new
I know someday I m gonna meet her
It s a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She ll know the way
and then she ll say she got the map from me
I ll say I m happy for her then I ll cry myself to sleep
Oh woah oh woah oh oh
I ve had I ve had too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they ll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up Wake up in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty two
And will you still want me will you still want me
Will you still want me when I m nothing new
Don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ah ah
Don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
I don t even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what s upstanding and right
It s kinda like a code yeah
And you ve been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey I am no one s exception
This I have previously learned
So don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ah ah
Don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you ve got me alone and I say
Don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You re the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it
If I hadn t once been just like her
So don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ah ah
Don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you ve got me alone and I say
Don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Oh oh
Oh oh
Call a cab lose my number
You re about to lose your girl
Call a cab lose my number
Let s consider this lesson learned
Don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ah ah
Don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you re coming home
Don t look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn t once been just like her
I m walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
And I never
Saw you comin
And I ll never
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I ve loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
I never
Saw you comin
And I ll never
Be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real
And I never
Saw you comin
And I ll never
Be the same oh
Oh I never
Saw you comin
And I ll never
Be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
He says he doesn t believe
anything much he hears these days
He says Why fall in love
just so you can watch it go away
He spends most of his nights
wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call just checking up on him
He s up 3 A M pacing
He says It s not just a phase I m in
My voice comes out begging
All this time I didn t know
You were breaking down
I d fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren t around
Too young to know it gets better
I ll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out it s hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he ll decide to leave instead
I call just checking up on him
He s up 5 A M wasted
Long gone not even listening
My voice comes out screaming
All this time I didn t know
You were breaking down
I d fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren t around
Too young to know it gets better
I ll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
If I was standing there in your apartment
I d take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I d say I love you even at your darkest and
Please don t go
I didn t know
You were breaking down
I d fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren t around
Too young to know it gets better
I ll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
I ll be your summer sun forever
At 3 A M pacing
All this time I didn t know
At 5 A M wasted
I d be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go
He says he doesn t believe anything
much he hears these days
I say Believe in one thing I won t go away
One two three four
Give me the keys I ll bring the car back around
We shouldn t be in this town
And my so called friends they don t know
I d drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don t say no no
There s a chain round your throat
Piece of paper where I wrote
I ll wait for you
There s a key on the chain there s a picture in a frame
Take it with you
And run like you d run from the law
Darling let s run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is run
Ooh we ll run
Ooh we ll run
Ooh we ll run
So you laugh like a child
And I ll sing like no one cares
No one to be no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don t say no no
And the note from the locket you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There s a heart on your sleeve
I ll take it when I leave
And hold it for you
And run like you d run from the law
Darling let s run
Run from it all
We can go like they re trying to chase us
Go where no one else is run
Ooh we ll run
Ooh we ll run
Ooh we ll run
There s been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you ll never let em tear us apart
And I ll hold onto you while we run
And we run and we run and we run
Like you d run from the law
And we run and we run and we run
Darling let s run And we run and we run and we run
Run from it all And we run and we run and we run
We can go where our eyes can take us
And we run and we run and we run
Go where no one else is run
And we run and we run and we run
Ooh we ll run And we run and we run and we run
Ooh we ll run And we run and we run and we run
Ooh we ll run And we run and we run and we run
Ooh and we ll run
I wish I could fly
I d pick you up and we d go back in time
I d write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
And so it goes
Every weekend the same party
I never go alone
And I don t seem broken hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I m going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
Cause they don t know about the night in the hotel
They weren t riding in the car when we both fell
Didn t read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don t know how much I miss you
I wish I could fly
I d pick you up and we d go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then we didn t know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other s hearts
But don t forget about the night out in L A
Dance in the kitchen chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whisper
No one knows how much I miss you
I wish I could fly
I d pick you up and we d go back in time
I d write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
I remember the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car when we both fell
I m the one on the phone as you whisper
Do you know how much I miss you
I wish that we could go back in time
And I d say to you
I miss you like it was the very first night
I wish I could fly
I d pick you up and we d go back in time
I d write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister s house
And you ve still got it in your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze
We re singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it s long gone and
That magic s not here no more
And I might be okay but I m not fine at all
Oh oh oh
Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother s telling stories bout you on the tee ball team
You tell me bout your past thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys fuck the patriarchy
Key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down any time now
He s gonna say it s love you never called it what it was
Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it s the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it s long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we d swear
To remember it all too well yeah
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all
They say all s well that ends well
But I m in a new hell every time you double cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me who was she
A never needing ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened
you that s what happened you
You who charmed my dad with self effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you re on a late night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
And he said It s supposed to be fun turning twenty one
Time won t fly it s like I m paralyzed by it
I d like to be my old self again but I m still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can t get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you ve ever known
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
You remember it all
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I ll get older but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I m a soldier who s returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
Just between us did the love affair maim you too
Cause in this city s barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell I remember it all too well
Just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
Just between us do you remember it all too well
Just between us I remember it Just between us all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it
I know I m probably better off on my own
Than lovin a man who didn t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn t 4 AM standing in the mirror
Saying to myself You know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I know I m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy oh I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I d always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh you never thought I d run
Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I hold onto this pride because these days it s all I have
And I gave to you my best
And we both know you can t say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would ve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah yeah
Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
We might still be in love if you were a better man
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
Yeah yeah
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would ve been the one
If you were a better man
I know that you like me
And it s kinda frightenin standin here waitin waitin
And I became hypnotized
By freckles and bright eyes tongue tied
But now you re so far away and I m down
Feelin like a face in the crowd
I m reachin for you terrified
Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do

A mеssage in a bottle is all I can do

And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot yeah

But you re just so cool run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly making me want you
And I don t know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I don t know why but with you I d dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless
So baby drive slow til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger s seat

Fast asleep in your city that s better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I ll bet your friends tell you she s better than me huh
Well I tried to fit in with your upper crust circles
Yeah they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh they sit around talkin about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved em that I hadn t heard of
But now that we re done and it s over
I bet you couldn t believe
When you realized I m harder to forget
than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me
You grew up in a silver spoon gated community
Glamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm no it wasn t a mansion
Just livin room dancin and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say you can t help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in you said we re too different
You laughed at my dreams rolled your eyes at my jokes
Mr Superior Thinking
Do you have all the space that you need
I don t have to be your shrink
to know that you ll never be happy
And I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me yes
I bet you think about me
Oh block it all out
The voices so loud sayin
Why did you let her go
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you re lookin for
Is the love that you had
Now you re out in the world searchin for your soul
Scared not to be hip scared to get old
Chasing make believe status last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered cause you were with me
But now that we re done and it s over
I bet it s hard to believe
That it turned out I m harder to forget than I was to leave
And yeah I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me yes
I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me when you re out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
Oh my god she s insane she wrote a song about me
I bet you think about me
MM mm mm mm
MM mm mm mm
MM mm mm mm yeah
Hey Stephen I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I ll be the one waiting there even when it s cold
Hey Stephen boy you might have me believing
I don t always have to be alone
Cause I can t help it if you look like an angel

Hey Stephen I ve been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you

You re on the phone with your girlfriend she s upset
She s going off about something that you said
Cause she doesn t get your humor like I do
I m in my room it s a typical Tuesday night
I m listening to the kind of music she doesn t like
And she ll never know your story like I do
Cause she wears short skirts I wear T shirts
She s Cheer Captain and I m on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you re looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I m the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can t you see
You belong with me you belong with me
Walking the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can t help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isn t this easy
And you ve got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven t seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you re fine I know you better than that
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
She wears high heels I wear sneakers
She s Cheer Captain and I m on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you re looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I m the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can t you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me you belong with me
Oh I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I m the one who makes you laugh
When you know you re bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it s with me
Can t you see that I m the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can t you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it s killing me to see you go after all this time
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It s the kind of ending you don t really wanna see
Cause it s tragedy and it ll only bring you down
Now I don t know what to be without you around
And we know it s never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
You re the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can t breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Never wanted this never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn t work out
And nothin we say is gonna save us from the fall out
And we know it s never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
You re the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can t breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
It s 2 A M feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it s not easy easy for me
It s 2 A M feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain t easy easy for me
And we know it s never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me oh
I can t breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
I m sorry I m sorry MM
I m sorry Yeah yeah I m sorry
I m sorry I m sorry Ooh ooh
I m sorry
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I ve been giving out chances every time
and all you do is let me down
And it s taken me this long baby but I ve figured you out
And you re thinking we ll be fine again
but not this time around
You don t have to call anymore
I won t pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don t wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you re sorry
But I don t believe you baby like I did before
You re not sorry
No no oh oh
You re looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn t know
Could ve loved you all my life
if you hadn t left me waiting in the cold
And you ve got your share of secrets
And I m tired of being last to know oh
And now you re asking me to listen
Cause it s worked each time before
But you don t have to call anymore
I won t pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don t wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you re sorry
But I don t believe you baby like I did before
You re not sorry
No no oh oh
You re not sorry
No no oh oh
You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would ve gone away no
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade
So you don t have to call anymore
I won t pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There s nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you re sorry
But I don t believe you baby like I did before
You re not sorry
No no oh oh
You re not sorry
No no oh oh
No no no no no no no no no no no no
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh no no no no no no
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It s the mornin of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain t seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody s way
It s your freshman year and you re gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven t seen you around before
Cause when you re fifteen
and somebody tells you they love you
You re gonna believe them
And when you re fifteen
feelin like there s nothin to figure out
Well count to ten take it in
This is life before you know who you re gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you re best friends
Laughin at the other girls who think they re so cool
We ll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you re on your very first date and he s got a car
And you re feelin like flyin
And your mama s waitin up and you re thinkin he s the one
And you re dancin round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
Cause when you re fifteen
and somebody tells you they love you
You re gonna believe them
And when you re fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round
But in your life you ll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn t know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
Cause when you re fifteen
and somebody tells you they love you
You re gonna believe them
And when you re fifteen don t forget to look before you fall
I ve found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you re supposed to be
I didn t know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
I took a chance I took a shot
And you might think I m bulletproof but i m not
You took a swing I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are
I m sick and tired of your attitude
I m feeling like I don t know you
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you re around
And here s to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you re doing to me
Tell me why
You could write a book on
how to ruin someone s perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what i m trying to say oh
I m sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you re around
Here s to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you re doing to me
Tell me why
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you re the only thing on my mind
I m sick and tired of your attitude
I m feeling like I don t know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
I m sick and tired of your reasons
I ve got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around
Here s to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you re doing to me
Tell me why
Why tell me why oh
I take a step back let you go
I told you I m not bulletproof
Now you know
Say you re sorry that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin on the days drag on
Stupid girl I shoulda known I shoulda known
That I m not a princess this ain t a fairytale
I m not the one you ll sweep off her feet
lead her up the stairwell
This ain t Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it s too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naïve got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn t know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings now I know
That I m not a princess this ain t a fairytale
I m not the one you ll sweep off her feet
lead her up the stairwell
This ain t Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it s too late for you and your white horse
To come around
And there you are on your knees
Beggin for forgiveness beggin for me
Just like I always wanted
But I m so sorry
Cause I m not your princess this ain t our fairytale
I m gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it s too late for you and your white horse
Now it s too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
Oh whoa whoa whoa
Try and catch me now oh
It s too late to catch me now
We were both young
When I first saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I m standing there
On a balcony in summer air
I see the lights
See the party the ball gowns
I see you make your way
Through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Beggin you Please don t go
And I said
Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I ll be waiting
All that s left to do is run
You ll be the Prince
And I ll be the Princess
It s a Love Story
Baby just say Yes
So I sneak out
To the garden to see you
We keep quiet
Cause we were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were Romeo
I was a Scarlett Letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
And I was beggin you Please don t go
And I said
Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I ll be waiting
All that s left to do is run
You ll be the Prince
And I ll be the Princess
It s a Love Story
Baby just say Yes
Romeo save me
They re trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult
But it s real
Don t be afraid
We ll make it out of this mess
It s a Love Story
Baby just say Yes
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin if you were ever comin around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said
Romeo save me
I ve been feelin so alone
I keep waiting for you
But you never come
Is this in my head
I don t know what to think
He knelt to the ground
And pulled out a ring
And said
Marry me Juliet
You ll never have to be alone
I love you
And that s all I really know
I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress
It s a Love Story
Baby just say Yes
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Cause we were both young
When I first saw you
I m five years old it s getting cold I ve got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I don t know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you re not scared of anything at all
Don t know if Snow White s house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
I m thirteen now
And don t know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop til I ve forgotten all their names
I don t know who I m going to talk to now at school
But I know I m laughing on the car ride home with you
Don t know how long it s going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today
I have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother inside and out
He s better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you re talking to me
It s the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy s smart
And you re the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn t know if you knew so I m taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today
Ooh it s a sad picture the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it s all the same another time and place
Repeating history and you re getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I ll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And we ll sing hallelujah we ll sing hallelujah
Oh oh
So we ve been outnumbered raided and now cornered
It s hard to fight when the fight ain t fair
We re getting stronger now finding things they never found
They might be bigger but we re faster and never scared
You can walk away say we don t need this
But there s something in your eyes says we can beat this
Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And we ll sing hallelujah we ll sing hallelujah
Oh oh
Tonight we ll stand get off our knees
Fight for what we ve worked for all these years
And the battle was long it s the fight of our lives
But we ll stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It s a revolution throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we ll sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah
I could go back to every laugh
But I don t wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don t wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I ll leave my window open
Cause I m too tired at night to call your name
Just know I m right here hoping
That you ll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don t wanna have to go that far
And I I ve got you down I know you by heart
And you don t even know where I start
Talk to yourself talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don t wait for the sky to clear
I ll leave my window open
Cause I m too tired at night to call your name
Just know I m right here hoping
That you ll come in with the rain
I ve watched you so long screamed your name
I don t know what else I can say
I ll leave my window open
Cause I m too tired at night for all these games
Just know I m right here hoping
That you ll come in with the rain
I could go back to every laugh
But I don t wanna go there anymore
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it s like
I couldn t ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it s 2AM and I m cursing your name
You re so in love that you act insane
And that s the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It s a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that s the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He s close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He s charming and endearing
And I m comfortable
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it s 2AM and I m cursing your name
You re so in love that you acted insane
And that s the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It s a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that s the way I loved you
He can t see the smile I m faking
And my heart s not breaking
Cause I m not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It s 2AM and I m cursing your name
I m so in love that I acted insane
And that s the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It s a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that s the way I loved you oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh oh
And that s the way I loved you oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh whoa
Never knew I could feel that much
And that s the way I loved you
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I m reaching out and I just can t tell you why
I m caught up in you I m caught up in you
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when you re close I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I m in this dream
It s like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that we ll be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven
It s half full and I won t wait here all day
I know you re saying that you d be here anyway
But you re untouchable burning brighter than the sun
Now that you re close I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I m in this dream
It s like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that we ll be together
Come on come on oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side standing next to me
You got to come on come on say that we ll be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven
I m caught up in you
Oh oh oh oh oh
But you re untouchable burning brighter than the sun
Now that you re close I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I m in this dream
It s like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that we ll be together
Come on come on oh
In the middle of the night when I m in this dream
It s like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that we ll be together
Come on come on come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side standing next to me
You got to come on come on say that we ll be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I m in this dream
It s like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on come on come on
Come on come on oh oh oh
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
They re spelling out your name oh
I like the way you sound in the morning
We re on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can t keep my focus
I watch you talk you didn t notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine I ll shine for you
Whoa oh I m feeling you baby
Don t be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby I m never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause I ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face oh
I ve never been so wrapped up honey
I like the way you re everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
Cause every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine I ll shine for you

Jump then fall into me into me yeah
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I don t feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now you re halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone he still hasn t called
And then you feel so low you can t feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you re here and it rains when you re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I m not so sure
So here s to everything coming down to nothing
Here s to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I don t anymore
And I stare at the phone he still hasn t called
And then you feel so low you can t feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you re here and it rains when you re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn t mean it baby I don t think so
Oh back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you re here and it rains when you re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone he still hasn t called
And then you feel so low you can t feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you re here and it rains when you re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn t mean it baby
You said forever and always yeah

Who s desperately in love with you

Good morning loneliness

When my world wakes up today

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I can t take my eyes off of you
I m no one special just another wide eyed girl
Who s desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
You played in bars you play guitar
And I m invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you ll never see you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio
So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I can t take my eyes off of you
I m no one special just another wide eyed girl
Who s desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
Sweet sweet superstar
Superstar
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn t I find a stain but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave em muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know you can scratch it right off
It s how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket
that s been spent and traded in
You can t change where it s been
Reminds me of me
I lived and I learned
Had you got burned
Held out and held on
God knows too long
And wasted time lost tears
Swore that I d get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I ve still got you all over me
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your don t you wish you had me grin
But I did so I smiled and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
And I lived and I learned
Had you got burned
Held out and held on
God knows too long
And wasted time lost tears
Swore that I d get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I ve still got you all over me
I lived and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I ve still got you all over me
I ve still got you all over me
Still got you all over me
I said I know
He said Need some time need some space
To think about all of this
I watched him go
He watched me crushed to the floor
On my knees just like that
He said When can I come back
I said That s when I wake up in the morning
That s when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I m crying
That s when I ll be waiting at the front gate
That s when never see your face
I let you in baby that s when
I said I know
He said I did you wrong made mistakes
Put you through all of this
Cause I let you go you let me think
That I ll be fine without you
Imagine that
So baby I ll come back
I said That s when I wake up in the morning
That s when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I m crying
That s when I ll be waiting at the front gate
That s when never see your face
I let you in baby that s when
And I said All this playing
Did you ever think of me
And he said
I said That s when I wake up in the morning
That s when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I m crying
That s when I ll be waiting at the front gate
That s when never see your face
I let you in baby that s when
I said I know
He said I need some time need some space
It wasn t just like a movie
The rain didn t soak through my clothes down to my skin
I m driving away and I I guess you could say
This is the last time I ll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I I still love you but I can t
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it s come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldn t keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby
The picture frame is empty
On the dresser vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we d always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I m becoming a part of your past
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it s come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldn t keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby
And there s so much that I can t touch
You re all I want but it s not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I m so scared of how this ends
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it s come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldn t keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it s come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldn t keep me
Oh you took me home I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby
Hey I knew I d run into you somewhere
It s been a while I didn t mean to stare
I heard she s nothin like me
I m sure she ll make you happy
But don t you
Don t you smile at me and ask me how I ve been
Don t you say you ve missed me if you don t want me again
You don t know how much I feel I love you still
So why don t you don t you
Ah ah ah ah
Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you
I ve tried but that s just somethin I can t do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn t do this
But don t you
Don t you smile at me and ask me how I ve been
Don t you say you ve missed me if you don t want me again
You don t know how much I feel I love you still
So why don t you don t you
So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say We re still friends
I don t wanna pretend
So if I see you again

Don t you Don t you say you ve missed me if you don t want me again
You don t You don t know how much I feel I love you still
So why don t you don t you
Ah ah ah ah
Don t you ah ah ah
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you re around
Can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
You ve got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it s getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you re around yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you re around
I can feel my heart
It s beating in my chest
Did you feel it
I can t put this down
But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignorin words that you were sayin
Tryna make me stay
I said This time I ve had enough
And you ve called a hundred times
But I m not picking up
Cause I m so mad I might tell you that it s over
But if you look a little closer
I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin pebbles
Screamin I m in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more
And don t you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride are sittin here alone
Goin through the photographs starin at the phone
I keep goin back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
Oh babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn t see
When I left I wanted you to chase after me yeah
I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin pebbles
Screamin I m in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more
And don t you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
And I ll scream out the window
I can t even look at you
I don t need you but I do I do I do
I say There s nothing you can say
To make this right again I mean it I mean it
But what I mean is
I said Leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin pebbles
Screamin I m in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more
And don t you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess I need you
We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy
I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy
When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed them all how
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy s farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That s sort of how I feel right now
And goodbye s so much harder
Cause we were happy
When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed them all how
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy s farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
Oh I hate those voices
Telling me I m not in love anymore
But they don t give me choices
And that s what these tears are for
Cause we were happy
We were happy
When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed them all how
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy s farm
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You re not sure which is worse
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom s ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass I dropped it
Champagne problems
You told your family for a reason
You couldn t keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one s celebrating
Dom Pérignon you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech you re speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn t give a reason
Champagne problems
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flushed and your flannel cured
This dorm was once a madhouse
I made a joke Well it s made for me
How evergreen our group of friends
Don t think we ll say that word again
And soon they ll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don t know the answer
Til someone s on their knees and asks you
She would ve made such a lovely bride
What a shame she s fucked in the head they said
But you ll find the real thing instead
She ll patch up your tapestry that I shred
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom s ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won t remember all my
Champagne problems
You won t remember all my
Champagne problems
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone I would have asked you
It s the kind of cold fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There s an ache in you put there by the ache in me
But if it s all the same to you
It s the same to me
So we could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
​ Tis the damn season write this down
I m stayin at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you in my hometown
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run but only so far
I escaped it too remember how you watched me leave
But if it s okay with you it s okay with me
We could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
​ Tis the damn season write this down
I m stayin at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I m missing your smile hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you in my hometown
Sleep in half the day just for old times sake
I won t ask you to wait if you don t ask me to stay
So I ll go back to L A and the so called friends
Who ll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I m fakin
And the heart I know I m breakin is my own
To leave the warmest bed I ve ever known
We could call it even
Even though I m leavin
And I ll be yours for the weekend
​ Tis the damn season
We could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
​ Tis the damn season write this down
I m stayin at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I m missing your smile hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you in my hometown
And it always leads to you in my hometown
He did it

Este s a friend of mine

Este wasn t there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere

And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este s bed and everything
No there ain t no doubt
Somebody s gotta catch him out cause
I think he did it but I just can t prove it He did it

Good thing my daddy made me get
a boating license when I was fifteen
And I ve cleaned enough houses
To know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este s sister s gonna swear she was with me
She was with me dude
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
They think she did it but they just can t prove it
They think she did it but they just can t prove it
She thinks I did it but she just can t prove it
No no body no crime

No no body no crime
I wasn t lettin up until the day he
No no body no crime
I wasn t lettin up until the day he died
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I m standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you Please don t go
And I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I ll be waiting all therе s left to do is run
You ll be the princе and I ll be the princess
It s a love story baby just say Yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause we re dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while oh oh
Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you Please don t go
And I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I ll be waiting all there s left to do is run
You ll be the prince and I ll be the princess
It s a love story baby just say Yes
Romeo save me they re trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it s real
Don t be afraid we ll make it out of this mess
It s a love story baby just say Yes
Oh oh
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said Romeo save me I ve been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I don t know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet you ll never have to be alone
I love you and that s all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
It s a love story baby just say Yes
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Cause we were both young when I first saw you
Honey when I m above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I m right down in it all the years I ve given
Is just shit we re dividin up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief I can t face reinvention
I haven t met the new me yet
There ll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would ve loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness
Tell me when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt
I hope she ll be your beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No I didn t mean that
Sorry I can t see facts through all of my fury
You haven t met the new me yet
There ll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things I believe
There is happiness
In our history across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight leave it all behind
And there is happiness
I can t make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it s the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too
Honey when I m above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow
where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven t met the new me yet
And I think she ll give you that
There ll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
In our history across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight leave it all behind
Oh leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness
I m like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open shut case
I never would ve known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
I m begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that s my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow
I could feel you sneakin in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I d cheat to win
The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
I m begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that s my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I m begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that s my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90s trend
Wait for the signal and I ll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open shut case
I guess I should ve known from the look on your face
Every bait and switch was a work of art
The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
I m begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that s my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I m begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that s my man
The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
I m begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that s my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I m begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that s my man
Hey that s my man
That s my man
Yeah that s my man
Every bait and switch was a work of art
That s my man
Hey that s my man
I m begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that s my man
Gleaming twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting I almost jump in
But I don t like a gold rush gold rush
I don t like anticipatin
my face in a red flush
I don t like that anyone
would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past quick brush
I don t like slow motion
double vision in rose blush
I don t like that falling feels
like flying til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don t like a gold rush
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t shirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered round
had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day old tea
Cause it could never be
Cause I don t like a gold rush gold rush
I don t like anticipatin
my face in a red flush
I don t like that anyone
would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past quick brush
I don t like slow motion
Double vision in rose blush
I don t like that falling feels
Like flying til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don t like a gold rush
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can t dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties I won t call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found
will never see a love as pure as it
Cause it fades into the gray of my day old tea
Cause it will never be
Gleaming twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting I almost jump in
How s one to know
I d meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don t I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living
Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but it s been promised to another
Oh I can t
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now I m covered in you
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He s in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what s only yours
Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but it s been promised to another
Oh I can t
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now I m covered
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose the time is near
What would he do if he found us out
Crescent moon coast is clear
Spring breaks loose but so does fear
He s gonna burn this house to the ground
How s one to know
I d live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we ll become
And drink my husband s wine
Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but it s been promised to another
Oh I can t
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now I m covered in you
And I m covered in you
So yeah it s a fire
It s a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah it s a war
It s the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it
Oh I can t
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now I m covered
In you in you
Now I m covered in you
In you
Hey Dorothea do you ever stop and think about me
When we were younger down in the park
Honey making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen s the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya
Ooh this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh but you don t like it that way
It s never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you re ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know you ll always know me Dorothea Uh uh
Dorothea Ah ah
Ooh you rе a queen sellin dreams
Sellin makeup and magazines
Ooh from you I d buy anything
Hey Dorothea do you ever stop and think about me
When it was calmer skipping the prom
just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn Dorothea they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met
under the bleachers Well
Ooh I guess I ll never know
Ooh and you ll go on with the show
But it s never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you re ever tired of being known for who you know
You know you ll always know me Dorothea Uh uh
Dorothea Ah ah
Ooh ooh
Ooh woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Dorothea Ah ah ah
Ah ah
Ooh
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said Dancin is a dangerous game
Oh I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I m never gonna love again
I ve got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You re a cowboy like me
Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I m waiting by the phone
Like I m sitting in an airport bar
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You re a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You re a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I d meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I ll pay for it
You re a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You re a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I d meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I ll pay for it
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I ve swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con
I ve had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You re a cowboy like me
And I m never gonna love again
I m never gonna love again
I m never gonna love again
Break my soul in two looking for you
But you re right here
If I can t relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to
And if this is the long haul
How d we get here so soon
Did I close my fist around something delicate
Did I shatter you
And I m sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go
The fast times the bright lights the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
The question pounds my head
What s a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me
Do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there
Will you forgive my soul
When you re too wise to trust me and too old to care
Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief the gift wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium
I think that I forgot to say your name
I m on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go
The fast times the bright lights the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my making you my
Making you my centerfold
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don t do
You re so much older and wiser and I
I wait by the door like I m just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it s all in my head tell me now
Tell me I ve got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I greet you with a battle hero s welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You re so much older and wiser and I
I wait by the door like I m just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it s all in my head tell me now
Tell me I ve got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
While you were out building other worlds where was I
Where s that man who d throw blankets over my barbed wire
I made you my temple my mural my sky
Now I m begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I m fine but what would you do if I
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me I could do it
If it s all in my head tell me now
Tell me I ve got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I sit and watch you
Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits walk in it til your high heels break
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short it was the wrong guy
Now I m all about you
I m all about you ah
Yeah yeah
I m all about you ah
Yeah yeah
Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us this time I m ready
Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short it was the wrong guy
Now I m all about you
I m all about you ah
Yeah yeah
I m all about you
No more keepin score
Now I just keep you warm Keep you warm
No more tug of war
Now I just know there s more Know there s more
No more keepin score
Now I just keep you warm Keep you warm
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore
Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he s passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits walk in it everywhere you go
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short I survived
Now I m all about you
And now I m all about you ah
And now I m all about you ah
Yeah yeah
I m all about you
And now Yeah yeah
I m all about you
Long story short it was a bad time
Long story short I survived
It s been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn t right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now
Yes I got your letter
Yes I m doing better
It cut deep to know ya right to the bone
Yes I got your letter
Yes I m doing better
I know that it s over I don t need your
Closure your closure
Don t treat me like
Some situation that needs to be handled
I m fine with my spite
And my tears and my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over
Yes I got your letter
Yes I m doing bettеr
It cut deep to know ya right to the bone
Yes I got your lеtter
Yes I m doing better
I know that it s over I don t need your
Closure your closure
Your closure your closure
I know I m just a wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends would iron it out so nice
Guilty guilty reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it s fake and it s oh so unnecessary
Yes I got your letter
Yes I m doing better
It cut deep to know ya right to the bone
Yes I got your letter
Yes I m doing better
I know that it s over I don t need your
Closure closure your closure
Your closure
I m doing good I m on some new shit
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop I didn t though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time
were never made
I guess you never know never know
And if you wanted me you really should ve showed
And if you never bleed you re never gonna grow
And it s alright now
But we were something don t you think so
Roaring twenties tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would ve been you
In my defense I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would ve been fun
If you would ve been the one
Ooh
I had this dream you re doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time
are over now
I guess you never know never know
And it s another day waking up alone
But we were something don t you think so
Roaring twenties tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would ve been you
In my defense I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would ve been fun
If you would ve been the one
I I I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today
We were something don t you think so
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would ve been sweet
If it could ve been me
In my defense I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would ve been fun
If you would ve been the one
Ooh
When your dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again he s insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She s a crook who was caught
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks
In your soul
You know when it s time to go
Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks
In your soul
You know when it s time to go
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Fifteen years fifteen million tears
Begging til my knees bled
I gave it my all he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He s got my past frozen behind glass
But I ve got me
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks
In my soul
I know when it s time to go
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
And you know in your soul
When it s time to go
You know you know you know you know
When it s time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go
Vintage tee brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile black lipstick sensual politics
When you are young they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin in your Levi s
Drunk under a streetlight I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby kiss it better I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone s bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls lose the one
When you are young they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Playing hide and seek and
Giving me your weekends I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone s bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I m bleedin
Cause I knew you
Steppin on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy I
I knew you
Leavin like a father
Running like water I
And when you are young they assume you know nothing
But I knew you d linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you d haunt all of my what ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I d curse you for the longest time
Chasin shadows in the grocery line
I knew you d miss me
once the thrill expired
And you d be standin in my front porch light
And I knew you d come back to me
You d come back to me
And you d come back to me
And you d come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone s bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind
And if I didn t know better
I d think you were talking to me now
If I didn t know better
I d think you were still around
What died didn t stay dead
What died didn t stay dead
You re alive you re alive in my head
What died didn t stay dead
What died didn t stay dead
You re alive so alive
Never be so politе
You forget your power
Nevеr wield such power
You forget to be polite
And if I didn t know better
I d think you were listening to me now
If I didn t know better
I d think you were still around
What died didn t stay dead
What died didn t stay dead
You re alive you re alive in my head
What died didn t stay dead
What died didn t stay dead
You re alive so alive
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You d always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should ve asked you questions
I should ve asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should ve kept every grocery store receipt
Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me
What died didn t stay dead
What died didn t stay dead
You re alive you re alive in my head
What died didn t stay dead
What died didn t stay dead
You re alive so alive
And if I didn t know better
I d think you were singing to me now
If I didn t know better
I d think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you re still around
I can see you standing honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin but the joke s not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin all this love out here in the hall
I think I ve seen this film before
And I didn t like the ending
You re not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now
You were my town now I m in exile seein you out
I think I ve seen this film before
Ooh ooh ooh
I can see you starin honey
Like he s just your understudy
Like you d get your knuckles bloody for me
Second third and hundredth chances
Balancin on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
I think I ve seen this film before
And I didn t like the ending
I m not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now
You were my crown now I m in exile seein you out
I think I ve seen this film before
So I m leaving out the side door
So step right out there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn t even hear me out You didn t even hear me out
You never gave a warning sign I gave so many signs
All this time
I never learned to read your mind
Never learned to read my mind
I couldn t turn things around
You never turned things around
Cause you never gave a warning sign
I gave so many signs
So many signs so many signs
You didn t even see the signs
I think I ve seen this film before
And I didn t like the ending
You re not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now
You were my town now I m in exile seein you out
I think I ve seen this film before
So I m leavin out the side door
So step right out there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn t even hear me out Didn t even hear me out
You never gave a warning sign I gave so many signs
All this time
I never learned to read your mind
Never learned to read my mind
I couldn t turn things around
You never turned things around
Cause you never gave a warning sign
I gave so many signs
You never gave a warning sign All this time
So many signs I never learned to read your mind
So many signs I couldn t turn things around
I couldn t turn things around
Cause you never gave a warning sign
You never gave a warning sign
You never gave a warning sign
Ah ah
I want you to know
I m a mirrorball
I ll show you every version of yourself tonight
I ll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break it s in a million pieces
Hush when no one is around my dear
You ll find me on my tallest tip toes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
Hush I know they said the end is near
But I m still on my tallest tip toes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
I want you to know
I m a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch
my shattered edges glisten
Hush when no one is around my dear
You ll find me on my tallest tip toes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
Hush I know they said the end is near
But I m still on my tallest tip toes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
And they called off the circus burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses
and the rodeo clowns
I m still on that tightrope
I m still trying everything to get you laughing at me
I m still a believer but I don t know why
I ve never been a natural all I do is try try try
I m still on that trapeze
I m still trying everything
to keep you looking at me
Because I m a mirrorball
I m a mirrorball
And I ll show you every version of yourself tonight
Gray November
I ve been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn t be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
Hey December
Guess I m feeling unmoored
Can t remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double crossed
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn t be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
Evermore
Can t not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh can we just get a pause
To be certain we ll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I m on waves out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross
And when I was shipwrecked Can t think of all the cost
I thought of you All the things that will be lost now
In the cracks of light Can we just get a pause
I dreamed of you To be certain we ll be tall again if you think of all the costs
It was real enough Whether weather be the frost
To get me through Or the violence of the dog days Or the violence of the dog days
I m on waves out being tossed
I m on waves out being tossed
I swear Is there a line that we could just go cross
You were there
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn t be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn t be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldn t be for evermore
Evermore
We gather here we line up
weepin in a sunlit room
And if I m on fire
you ll be made of ashes too
Even on my worst day did I deserve babe
All the hell you gave me
Cause I loved you I swear I loved you
Til my dying day
I didn t have it in myself to go with grace
And you re the hero flying around saving face
And if I m dead to you
Why are you at the wake
Cursing my name wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
We gather stones never knowing what they ll mean
Some to throw some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn t want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me
I didn t have it in myself to go with grace
Cause when I d fight you used to tell me I was brave
And if I m dead to you
Why are you at the wake
Cursing my name wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want just not home
And you can aim for my heart go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you When I m screaming at the sky
And when you can t sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies
I didn t have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you re tossing out blame drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you re cursing my name wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
Salt air and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of Are you sure
Never have I ever before
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin I could write my name on it
Will you call when you re back at school
I remember thinkin I had you
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Back when we were still changin for the better
Wanting was enough
For me it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Canceled plans just in case you d call
And say Meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love and saying us
Cause you weren t mine to lose
You weren t mine to lose oh
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember
Remember when I pulled up
and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case you d call
Back when I was livin for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall
Remember when I pulled up
and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case you d call
Back when I was livin for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall
Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case you d call
Back when I was livin for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all for the hope of it all
Friends break up friends get married
Strangers get born strangers get buried
Trends change rumors fly through new skies
But I m right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I m right where you left me
Help I m still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross legged in the dim light
They say What a sad sight
I I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on I I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective but I sat and stared
Right where you left me
You left me no you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me you left me no you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen
Time went on for everybody else
She won t know it she s still twenty three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion
Breakups happen every day you don t have to lose it
She s still twenty three inside her fantasy
And you re sitting in front of me
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross legged in the dim light everything was just right
I I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on
Help I m still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross legged in the dim light
They say What a sad sight
I I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned up hair
I m sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas but I m unaware
Cause I m right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can t bear witness
And it s been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong
I m right where
You left me
You left me no you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast
took her mind off St Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said
How did a middle class divorcée do it
The wedding was charming if a little gauche
There s only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows if she never showed up
what could ve been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows if she never showed up
What could ve been
There goes the most shameless woman
this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness
their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
Who knows if I never showed up
what could ve been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time
I ve been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels now they re rusting
I didn t know if you d care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could ve followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don t quite know what to say
But I m here in your doorway
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I m mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates
and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn t pour the whiskey
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least I m trying
And it s hard to be at a party
when I feel like an open wound
It s hard to be anywhere these days
when all I want is you
You re a flashback in a film reel
on the one screen in my town
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
And maybe I don t quite know what to say
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least I m trying
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money
Time curious time
Gave me no compasses gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn t see
And isn t it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me
Ooh oh ooh ooh
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
Time mystical time
Cutting me open then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn t see
And isn t it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
Something wrapped
all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
Time wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies
And it s cool
Baby with me
And isn t it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart won t tell no other
And though I can t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And I ve been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won t have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I I
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart won t tell no other
And though I can t recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We ll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long
Betty I won t make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom but
I think it s cause of me
Betty one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It s like I couldn t breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can t believe a word she says
Most times but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me Would you want me
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing
I m only seventeen I don t know anything
But I know I miss you
Betty I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds you know that
Plus I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can t believe a word she says
Most times but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me Would you want me
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing
I m only seventeen I don t know anything
But I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said James get in let s drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty I m here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it s finally sinkin in
Betty right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah I showed up at your party
Yeah I showed up at your party
Will you have me Will you love me
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends
If you kiss me will it be just like I dreamed it
Will it patch your broken wings
I m only seventeen I don t know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you re out for a run
You ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots
And that s the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It s born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
And that s the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times
And you wanna scream
Don t call me kid don t call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know
I can t see with anyone else
Don t call me kid don t call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language
I can t speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you I would ruin myself
A million little times
Keep your helmet keep your life son
Just a flesh wound here s your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
Sir I think he s bleeding out
And some things you just can t speak about
With you I serve with you I fall down down
Watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out
Something med school did not cover
Someone s daughter someone s mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
Doc I think she s crashing out
And some things you just can t speak about
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you ve seen
With you I serve with you I fall down down Down
Watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out
With you I serve with you I fall down Down down Down
Watch you breathe in Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathing out Out out Out
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you ve seen
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground
Stood on the cliffside screaming Give me a reason
Your faithless love s the only hoax I believe in
Don t want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire
Stood on the cliffside screaming Give me a reason
Your faithless love s the only hoax I believe in
Don t want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died
so what s the movie for
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won
so what s the point of keeping score
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Ah ah ah
Darling this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don t want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
What did you think I d say to that
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back
They strike to kill and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home
Do you see my face in the neighbor s lawn
Does she smile
Or does she mouth Fuck you forever
Every time you call me crazy I get more crazy
What about that
And when you say I seem angry I get more angry
And there s nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you ll poke that bear til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there s nothing like a mad woman
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin at your yacht
They say move on but you know I won t
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It s obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together
Every time you call me crazy I get more crazy
What about that
And when you say I seem angry I get more angry
And there s nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you ll poke that bear til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there s nothing like a mad woman
I m taking my time taking my time
Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad should be scathing like me but
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that
Is it romantic how all of my elegies eulogize me
I m not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones
Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
I don t belong and my beloved neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I m setting off but not without my muse
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart stopping waves of hurt
I ve come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth
Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
I don t belong and my beloved neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I m setting off but not without my muse
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
Cause I haven t moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief
Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
I don t belong and my beloved neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I m setting off but not without my muse
No not without you
How many days did I spend thinking
Bout how you did me wrong wrong wrong
Lived in the shade you were throwing
Til all of my sunshine was gone gone gone
And I couldn t get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake so yeah
Your name on my lips tongue tied
Free rent living in my mind
But then something happened one magical night
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didn t
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn t love it isn t hate it s just indifference
I forgot that you
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down down down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground ground ground
And I would ve stuck around for ya
Would ve fought the whole town so yeah
Would ve been right there front row
Even if nobody came to your show
But you showed who you are then one magical night
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didn t
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn t love it isn t hate it s just indifference
I forgot that you
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It s all just a blur
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didn t
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did I did I did
It isn t hate it s just indifference
It isn t love it isn t hate it s just indifference
So yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
Oh yeah you re right I want it
Bad bad boy shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it
Oh yeah you re right I want it
Killing me slow out the window
I m always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice angels roll their eyes
What doesn t kill me makes me want you more
And it s new the shape of your body
It s blue the feeling I ve got
And it s ooh whoa oh
It s a cruel summer
It s cool that s what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh whoa oh
It s a cruel summer
With you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I m not dying Oh yeah you re right I want it
We say that we ll just screw it up in these trying times
We re not trying Oh yeah you re right I want it
So cut the headlights summer s a knife
I m always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed you ll be the last to know
Oh it s new the shape of your body
It s blue the feeling I ve got
And it s ooh whoa oh
It s a cruel summer
It s cool that s what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh whoa oh
It s a cruel summer
With you
I m drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar Oh
Said I m fine but it wasn t true
I don t wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate Oh
And I scream For whatever it s worth
I love you ain t that the worst thing you ever heard
He looks up grinning like a devil
It s new the shape of your body
It s blue the feeling I ve got
And it s ooh whoa oh
It s a cruel summer
It s cool that s what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh whoa oh
It s a cruel summer
With you
I m drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar Oh
Said I m fine but it wasn t true
I don t wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate Oh
And I scream For whatever it s worth
I love you ain t that the worst thing you ever heard
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Our coming of age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer it s clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it s just around the corner darlin
Cause it lives in me
No I could never give you peace
But I m a fire
and I ll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love s for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil s in the details but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends
It s like I m wasting your honor
And you know that I d swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes
when two people understand each other
Family that I chose
Now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough
But there s robbers to the east clowns to the west
I d give you my sunshine give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you re standin with me
But I m a fire
and I ll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love s for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil s in the details but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace

You know I adore you I m crazier for you
Than I was at 16 lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens
Marching band playing
I m lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I m feeling hopeless
Ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns
I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life Ah
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days I counted miles
To see you there to see you there
It s been a long time coming but
It s you and me that s my whole world
They whisper in the hallway
She s a bad bad girl Okay
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games you win stupid prizes
It s you and me there s nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince Okay
We re so sad we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
My team is losing battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I m feeling helpless the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then where are the wise men
Darling I m scared Ah
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days I counted miles
To see you there to see you there
And now the storm is coming but
It s you and me that s my whole world
They whisper in the hallway
She s a bad bad girl Okay
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games you win stupid prizes
It s you and me there s nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince Okay

Combat I m ready for combat
I say I don t want that but what if I do
Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I ve got a hundred thrown out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come easy they go
I jump from the train I ride off alone
I never grew up it s getting so old
Help me hold on to you
I ve been the archer I ve been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay
Dark side I search for your dark side
But what if I m alright right right right here
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you
I ve been the archer I ve been the prey
Screaming who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay
I see right through me I see right through me
Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
All the king s horses all the king s men
Couldn t put me together again
Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you
I ve been the archer I ve been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay
I see right through me I see right through me
Who could stay
Who could stay
Who could stay
You could stay
You could stay
Combat I m ready for combat
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I ve read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
Ayy
Kiss me once
Cause you know I had a long night Oh
Kiss me twice cause it s gonna be alright Uh
Three times cause I ve waited my whole life

I hate accidents
Except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh that s right
Darling you re the one I want and
Paper rings and picture frames and dirty dreams
Oh you re the one I want
In the winter in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first I went in too
I m with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother s wall
Honey without all the exes fights and flaws
We wouldn t be standing here so proud so
Ayy

Kiss you twice cause it s gonna be alright Uh

We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
This is our place we make the rules
And there s a dazzling haze
A mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years
Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home
You re my my my my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place we make the call
And I m highly suspicious
that everyone who sees you wants you
I ve loved you three summers now honey
But I want em all
Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home
Forever and ever
You re my my my my lover
Ladies and gentlemen will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart s been borrowed and yours has been blue
All s well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you ll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table I ll save you a seat lover
Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home
Forever and ever
You re my my my my
Oh you re my my my my
Darling you re my my my my lover
I would be complex I would be cool
They d say I played the field
Before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made
Would make me more of a boss to you
I d be a fearless leader
I d be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What s that like
I m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I d get there quicker if I was a man
And I m so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man then I d be the man
I d be the man
I d be the man
They d say I hustled put in the work
They wouldn t shake their heads
And question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas
And power moves
And they would toast to me oh let the players play
I d be just like Leo in Saint Tropez
I m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I d get there quicker if I was a man
And I m so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man then I d be the man
I d be the man
I d be the man
What s it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models
And it s all good if you re bad
And it s okay if you re mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I d be a bitch not a baller
They d paint me out to be bad
So it s okay that I m mad
I m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I d get there quicker
If I was a man You know that
And I m so sick of them coming at me again
Coming at me again
Cause if I was a man If I was a man
Then I d be the man Then I d be the man
I m so sick of running as fast as I can As fast as I can
Wondering if I d get there quicker if I was a man Hey
And I m so sick of them coming at me again
Coming at me again
Cause if I was a man If I was a man
Then I d be the man
I d be the man
I d be the man Oh
I d be the man Yeah
I d be the man I d be the man
If I was a man then I d be the man
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger
Than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I said casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home
I hope I never lose you
Hope it never ends
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
That s the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystified by how
This city screams your name
And baby I m so terrified of
if you ever walk away
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
Windows swung right open autumn air
Jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof you and I
I hope I never lose you
Hope it never ends
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
That s the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystified by how
This city screams your name
And baby I m so terrified of
if you ever walk away
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion listen
I hope I never lose you
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh never again
And baby I get mystified by how
This city screams your name
And baby I m so terrified of
If you ever walk away
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
I don t wanna lose you Hope it never ends
I d never walk Cornelia Street again
I don t wanna lose you Yeah
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I said casually in the car
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor s office lighting
I didn t tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you
Desperate people find faith
So now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you
Ooh ah
Soon you ll get better
Ooh ah
Soon you ll get better
Ooh ah
You ll get better soon
Cause you have to
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses
You make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn t real
I ll paint the kitchen neon I ll brighten up the sky
I know I ll never get it
There s not a day that I won t try
And I say to you
Ooh ah
Soon you ll get better
Ooh ah
Soon you ll get better
Ooh ah
You ll get better soon
Cause you have to
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to
What am I supposed to do
If there s no you
This won t go back to normal if it ever was
It s been years of hoping
And I keep saying it because
Cause I have to
Ooh ah
You ll get better
Ooh ah
Soon you ll get better
Ooh ah
You ll get better soon

Soon you ll get better

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but it s not enough
Cause the morning comes and you re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier s still flickering here
Cause I can t pretend it s okay when it s not
It s death by a thousand cuts
I dress to kill my time I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it ll be alright
They say I don t know
And what once was ours is no one s now
I see you everywhere the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love one for the ages
But if the story s over why am I still writing pages
Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but it s not enough
Cause the morning comes and you re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier s still flickering here
Cause I can t pretend it s okay when it s not
It s death by a thousand cuts
My heart my hips my body my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn t touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I m searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs our films united we stand
Our country guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans
My time my wine my spirit my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn t take up
Gave you so much but it wasn t enough
But I ll be alright it s just a thousand cuts
I get drunk but it s not enough
Cause you re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier s still flickering here
Cause I can t pretend it s okay when it s not
No it s not
It s death by a thousand cuts You didn t touch
Tryna find a part of me that you didn t touch
My body my love my trust
It s death by a thousand cuts
But it wasn t enough it wasn t enough no no
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it ll be alright
They say I don t know
I blew things out of proportion
Now you re blue
Put you in jail for something you didn t do
I pinned your hands behind your back oh
Thought I had reason to attack but no
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry til it blows up til there s no us
Why d I have to break what I love so much
It s on your face and I m to blame I need to say
Hey it s all me in my head
I m the one who burned us down
But it s not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don t wanna do I don t wanna do this to you Ooh
I don t wanna lose I don t wanna lose this with you Ooh
I need to say hey it s all me just don t go
Meet me in the afterglow
It s so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight oh
I lived like an island punished you in silence
Went off like sirens just crying
Why d I have to break what I love so much
It s on your face don t walk away I need to say
Hey it s all me in my head
I m the one who burned us down
But it s not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don t wanna do I don t wanna do this to you Ooh
I don t wanna lose I don t wanna lose this with you Ooh
I need to say hey it s all me just don t go
Meet me in the afterglow
Tell me that you re still mine
Tell me that we ll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it s not my fault
Tell me that I m all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say
Hey it s all me in my head
I m the one who burned us down
But it s not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don t wanna do I don t wanna do this to you Ooh
I don t wanna lose I don t wanna lose this with you Ooh
I need to say hey it s all me just don t go
Meet me in the afterglow

School bell rings walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves you give me one
Wanna hang out Yeah sounds like fun
Video games you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents
It s nice to have a friend Ooh

Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down no curfew
20 questions we tell the truth
You ve been stressed out lately yeah me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand
It s nice to have a friend Ooh

Church bells ring carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow

Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I d die for you
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I d fly to you
And I can t talk to you when you re like this
Staring out the window
Like I m not your favorite town
I m New York City
I still do it for you babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you re led by blind faith blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion s in your lips
Even if it s a false god
We d still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it s a false god
We d still worship this love
We d still worship this love
We d still worship this love
I know heaven s a thing
I go there when you touch me honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you
And you can t talk to me when I m like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You re the West Village
You still do it for me babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you re led by blind faith blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion s in your lips
Even if it s a false god
We d still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it s a false god
We d still worship this love
We d still worship this love
We d still worship this love ah
Still worship this love
Even if it s a false god
Even if it s a false god
Still worship this love
Knew he was a killer
First time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved
And left haunted
But if he s a ghost
Then I can be a phantom
Holdin him for ransom
Some some boys are tryin too hard
He don t try at all though
Younger than my exes
But he act like such a man so
I see nothing better I keep him forever
Like a vendetta ta

Touch me and you ll never be alone

I know I m gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it
Me I was a robber
First time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off
And never saying sorry
But if I m a thief
Then he can join the heist
And we ll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer
Burton to this Taylor
Every lover known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now

Never be the same now now

Believe me
Even when we d argue
We d not do it for long
And you understand
The good and bad end up in a song
For all your beautiful traits
And the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws paranoia
And insecurities
I ve made mistakes and made some choices
Is that s hard to deny
After the storm
Something was born on the 4th of July
Our past days were the fun
This endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue
I ll never say it

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I ve crossed unforgiven
I ll tell you the truth but never goodbye
I don t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don t wanna think of anything else
Now that I thought of you
I ve been sleeping so long in a 20 year dark night
And now I see daylight I only see daylight
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves
And refused to settle down
Maybe I ve stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers
Because it s morning now
It s brighter now now
I don t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I can never look away
I don t wanna think of anything else
Now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
I ve been sleeping so long in a 20 year dark night
Now I m wide awake
And now I see daylight Daylight
I only see daylight Daylight
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
And I can still see it all In my mind
All of you all of me Intertwined
I once believed love would be Black and white
But it s golden Golden
And I can still see it all In my head
Back and forth from New York Sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be Burning red
But it s golden
Like daylight like daylight
Like daylight daylight
I don t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I can never look away
And I don t wanna think of anything else
Now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
I ve been sleeping so long in a 20 year dark night
Now I m wide awake
And now I see daylight I see daylight
I only see daylight Ah
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight Ah
And I can still see it all
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
And I can still see it all back and forth from New York
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
I once believed love would be burning red
Like daylight
It s golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I m afraid of I m afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I I just think that
You are what you love
This ain t for the best
My reputation s never been worse so
You must like me for me
We can t make
Any promises now can we babe
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the east side
Where you at
Phone lights up my nightstand
In the black
Come here you can meet me
In the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes
Look at you

Just think of
the fun things we could do
Cause I like you
This ain t for the best
My reputation s never been worse so
You must like me for me

Third floor on the west side me and you
Handsome you re a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home

Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here honey

Cause I like you

My reputation s never been worse so
You must like me for me

No nothing good starts in a getaway car
It was the best of times the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn t mean it
And you didn t see it
The ties were black the lies
were white
In shades of grey in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well I was
lyin to myself
I knew it from the first old fashioned
We were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark
You were drivin the getaway car
We were flyin but we d never get far
Don t pretend it s such a mystery
Think about the place
Where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should ve known I d be the first to leave
Think about the place
Where you first met me
In a getaway car oh oh
No they never get far oh ahh
No nothing good starts in a getaway car
It was the great escape the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren t thinkin
And I was just drinkin
Well he was runnin after us
I was screamin go go go
But with three of us honey it s a sideshow
And a circus ain t a love story
And now we re both sorry
we re both sorry
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well every man for himself
I knew it from the first old fashioned
We were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun
Shot to the heart
You were drivin the getaway car
We were flyin but we d never get far
Don t pretend it s such a mystery
Think about the place
Where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
I shoulda known I d be the first to leave
Think about the place
Where you first met me
In a getaway car oh oh
No they never get far oh ahh
No nothing good starts in a getaway car
We were jet set Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switch to the other side
To the other si I I I ide
It s no surprise I turned you in
Cause us traitors never win
I m in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag
and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me
Drivin the getaway car
We were flyin but we never get far
don t pretend
Don t pretend it s such a mystery
Think about the place where
you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat
of your heart should ve known
Should ve known I d be
the first to leave
Think about the place
where you first met me
In a getaway car oh oh
No we never get far oh ahh
No nothing good starts in a getaway car
Ridin in a getaway car
I was cryin in a getaway car
I was dyin in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin in a getaway car
I was cryin in a getaway car
I was dyin in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
See you in the dark
All eyes on you my magician

Cut me into pieces
Gold cage hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin trip trippin when you re gone
Cause we break down a little
And when you get me alone

Right into place
Get caught up in the moments

And I m yours to lose
You know I m not a bad girl but I
Do bad things with you

Meet you in a bar
All eyes on me your illusion is
All eyes on us

Wear you like a necklace

But I got your heart
Skippin skip skippin when I m gone
Cause we break down a little
And when you get me alone

Of the fool
No I don t like you
I don t like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn t cool
No I don t like you
Ooh
But I got smarter
I got harder
In the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead
I do it all the time
I got a list of names
And yours is in red underlined
I check it once
Then I check it twice
Ooh
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don t like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out
And threw a feast What
The world moves on
Another day
Another drama drama
But not for me
Not for me
All I think about is karma
And then the world moves on
But one thing is for sure
Maybe I got mine
But you ll all get yours
But I got smarter
I got harder

Deep blue but you painted me golden
Oh and you held me close

Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing
In the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling
You had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking
Putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world
Who could take it

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied

Yeah we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied

Deep fears that the world would divide us
So baby can we dance

Oh cause it s gravity

Swaying as the room burned down

If I could dance with you again

Swaying as the room burned down

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk
And made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field
Being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend he s older than us
He s in the club doing I don t know what
You re so cool it makes me hate you so much
I hate you so much
Whiskey on ice sunset and vine
You ve ruined my life by not being mine
You re so gorgeous
I can t say anything to your face
cause look at your face
And I m so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say
You re gorgeous
You should take it as a compliment
That I m talking to everyone here but you
but you but you
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room
dark room dark room
If you got a girlfriend I m jealous of her
But if you re single it s honestly worse
cause you re so gorgeous it actually hurts

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink
And drown and die

Our secret moments
in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me
a golden tattoo
All of this silence and patience
pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking
from holding back from you
All of this silence and patience
pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah ha ha ha ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I don t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so
you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha ha ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so
you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha ha ah
Inescapable I m not even gonna try
And if I get burned
at least we were electrified
I m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we re both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about
All of this silence and patience
pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking
from holding back from you
Ha ah ah
All of this silence and patience
pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah ha ha ha ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I don t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so
you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha ha ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so

Take it oh ha ha
Ha ah ah ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
Only bought this dress
so you could take it off
Ha ah ah ha ah ah ha ah ah ah
Only bought this dress
so you could take it off
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times
you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies
you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake
I can t explain this
Ah ha ha ha ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I don t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so
you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha ha ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so

Take it oh ha ha ha ah
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so
you could take it off
You made your mark on me golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so
you could take it off
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jumping in the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
So why d you have to rain on my parade
I m shaking my head
I m locking the gates
This is why we can t
have nice things darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can t have
nice things honey
Did you think I wouldn t hear
All the things you said about me
This is why we can t
have nice things
It was so nice being friends again
There I was giving you a second chance
But then you stabbed my back
While shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don t try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind twist you
And so I took an ax to a mended fence
But I m not the only friend
you ve lost lately
If only you weren t
So shady
This is why we can t have
nice things darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can t have
nice things honey
Did you think I wouldn t hear
All the things you said about me
This is why we can t have
Here s a toast to my real friends
They don t care about that he said she said
And here s to my baby
He ain t reading what
they call me lately
And here s to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here s to you
Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha I can t even say it with a straight face
This is why we can t have
nice things darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can t have
nice things honey
Did you think I wouldn t hear
All the things you said about me
This is why we can t have
nice things darling
And here s to my real friends
Because you break them
I had to take them away
And here s to my baby
This is why we can t have
nice things darling
He didn t care about that he said she said
Did you think I wouldn t hear
All the things you said about me
This is why we can t have

Nice to meet you where you been
I could show you incredible things
Magic madness heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love s a game wanna play
New money suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain t it funny rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey let s be friends
I m dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it s gonna be forever
Or it s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it s over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex lovers
They ll tell you I m insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause we re young and we re reckless
We ll take this way too far
It ll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex lovers
They ll tell you I m insane
But I got a blank space baby
And I ll write your name
Cherry lips crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses pretty lies
You re the king baby I m your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
But the worst s yet to come
Screaming crying perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
Oh my God who is she
I get drunk on jealousy
But you ll come back each time you leave
Cause darling I m a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it s gonna be forever
Or it s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it s over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex lovers
They ll tell you I m insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause we re young and we re reckless
We ll take this way too far
It ll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex lovers

But I got a blank space baby
And I ll write your name
Boys only want love if it s torture
Don t say I didn t say I didn t warn ya
Boys only want love if it s torture

People like you always want back

All I know is that you drove us
Off the road
Stay Hey all you had to do was
Stay had me in the palm of your hand
Then why d you have to go
And lock me out when I let you in
Stay Hey now you see you want it

People like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

Walking through a crowd
The village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn t heard before
And it said
Welcome to New York
It s been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It s been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

But they never blind me me
Welcome to New York

On apartment floors
Took our broken hearts
Put them in a drawer

And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls
Welcome to New York

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown but it s alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody s heard from me for months
I m doing better than I ever was
Cause
My baby s fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I m the one he s walking to
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby s fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I m brand new
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to
All my flowers
grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the
same mistakes every time
Bridges burn I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I m laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night
My baby s fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I m the one he s walking to
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby s fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I m brand new
Call it what you want
call it what you want call it
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to
I want to wear his initial
On a chain round my neck
Chain round my neck
Not because he owns me
But cause he really knows me
Wich is more than I can say I
I recall late November
holding my breath
Slowly I said
You don t need to save me
But would you run away with me
Yes would you run away
My baby s fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I m the one he s walking to
Call it what you want
call it what you want call it
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby s fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I m brand new
Call it what you want

Looking at it now it all seemed so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet good
Are we out of the woods
Looking at it now last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn t quite forget
When we decided we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying flying
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet good
Are we out of the woods
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying
Baby I did too
But when the sun came up
I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn t take the heat
I walked out I said I m setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up
You were looking at me
You were looking at me oh
You were looking at me
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
I remember
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet good
Oh I remember
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet good
There s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before
Don t read the last page
But I stay when you re lost and I m scared and you re turning away
I want your midnights
But I ll be cleaning up bottles
with you on new year s day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it s going to be a long road
I ll be there through the toast of the town babe
Or if you strike out and you re crawling home
Don t read the last page
But I stay when it s hard or it s wrong
Or we re making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I ll be cleaning up bottles with you on new year s day
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please don t ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don t ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
There s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore
Don t read the last page
But I stay
when it s hard or it s wrong
Or we re making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I ll be cleaning up bottles with you on new year s day
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please don t ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don t ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
It s two A M in your car
Windows down past my street
The memories start
You say it s in the past
And drive straight ahead
You re thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still don t know what I never said
I wish you would come back
Wish I d never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
Wish you were right here right now
It s all good
I wish you would
It s two A M in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We were crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us wanna turn back around
I wish you would come back
Wish I d never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
Wish you were right here right now
It s all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
Wish you were right here right now
It s all good
I wish you would
I wish I wish I
I wish I wish I
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come rushing
Stand back wasted
I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would
It s two A M here we are
I see your face
Hear my voice in the dark
We were crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Wish I d never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
Wish you were right here right now
It s all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I d never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
Wish you were right here right now
It s all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
Wish you were right here right now
It s all good
I wish you would
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come rushing
Stand back wasted
I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would
I wish I wish I
I wish I wish I wish you would

NT Bad Blood Expressão utilizada quando há um
desentendimento uma rixa do passado entre duas pessoas
Flashing lights
And we took a wrong turn
And we fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
Cause nothing s as it seems
And spinning out of control
Didn t they tell us
Don t rush into things
Didn t you flash your green eyes at me
Haven t you heard what becomes of curious minds
Didn t it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should ve slept with one eye open at night
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland in wonderland
In wonderland in wonderland
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams
Didn t they tell us
Don t rush into things
Didn t you flash your green eyes at me
Didn t you calm my fears
With with a Cheshire cat smile
Didn t it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It s all fun and games til somebody
Loses their mind
But darling we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland in wonderland
In wonderland in wonderland
I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland
We both went mad
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland

Clear blue water high tides came
And brought you in
And I could go on and on on and on
And I will
Skies grew darker currents swept you out again
And you are just gone and gone
And gone and gone
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
Tossing turning
Struggled through the night
With someone new
And I could go on and on
On and on
Lantern burning
Flickered in my mind for only you
But you re still gone and gone
And gone and gone
In losing grip and sinking ships
You showed up just in time
This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
This love this love this love
Your kiss my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you re young you just run
But you come back to what you need
This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
This love this love this love
One look dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast you play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof not much but you saw enough
Small talk he drives
Coffee at midnight
Moonlight reflects the chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof one touch and you felt enough
You can hear it in the silence the silence
You can feel it on the way home way home
You can see it with the lights out lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love
Morning his place
Burnt toast Sunday
You keep his shirt he keeps his word
For once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step not much but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes strange look on his face
Pauses then says you re my best friend
And you knew what it was
He is in love
You can hear it in the silence the silence
You can feel it on the way home way home
You can see it with the lights out lights out
You are in love true love
So it goes
You two are dancing in a snowglobe round and round
And he keeps a picture of you
In his office downtown
And you understand now why
They lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I ve spent my whole life
Trying to put it into words
Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence the silence
You can feel it on the way home way home
You can see it with the lights out lights out
You are in love true love
You can hear it in the silence the silence
You can feel it on the way home way home
You can see it with the lights out lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love
He said let s get out of this town
Drive out of the city away from the crowd
I thought heaven can t help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He s so tall and handsome as hell
He s so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you ll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you ll see me again
Even if it s just in your wildest dreams
Wildest dreams oh
I said no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair
His clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He s so tall and handsome as hell
He s so bad but he does it so well
And when we ve had our very last kiss
My last request it is
Say you ll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you ll see me again
Even if it s just in your wildest dreams
Wildest dreams oh
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
Say you ll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you ll see me again
Even if it s just pretend
Say you ll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you ll see me again
Even if it s just in your wildest dreams
Wildest dreams oh
Even if it s just in your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams oh
I I I I I I I
You just stand with your hand
On my waist line
It s a scene and we re out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It s a bad sign bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
I see the vultures circling in dark clouds
Love s a fragile little flame that can burn out
It can burn out
Cause they got the cages
They got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run
Baby I know places we won t be found in
And they ll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places I know places
Lights flash and we ll run for the fences
Let them say what they want we won t hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time
Just grab my hand and don t ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run
Baby I know places we won t be found in
And they ll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places I know places
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don t ever drop it
My love
Baby I know places we won t be found in
And they ll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places I know places
They take their shots we re bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me it s always you
I know places
In the dead of night your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you it s always me
I know places
I I I I I I I
We re all bored we re all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren t coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better
We re so young we re on the road to ruin
We play dumb we know exactly what we re doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a class room
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
We re the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We re too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free
We re all here the lights and boys are blinding
We hang back it s all in the timing
It s poker you can t see it in my face
But I m about to play my Ace
We need love but all we want is danger
We team up and switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
We re the new romantics
Come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We re too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free
Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It s so romantic so romantic
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
We re the new romantics
Come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We re too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we d grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
You still all over me
Like a wine stained dress I can t wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
As the sky turned black like a perfect storm
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning that s when I could finally breathe
By morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust
They covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning that s when I could finally breathe
By morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
See I think I am finally clean
Ten months sober I must admit
Just because you re clean
Don t mean you don t miss it
Ten months older I won t give in
Now that I m clean I m never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we d grown together died of thirst
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning that s when I could finally breathe
By morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning that s when I could finally breathe
By morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Finally clean think I m finally clean
Think I m finally clean
Loving him is like driving
A new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind passionate as sin
Ended so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you re already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn so bright
Just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I d never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
You never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
To your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there s no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing
You d never found out
That love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I d never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
You never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Oh red
Burning red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks in echoes
Tell myself it s time now
Gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
Burning red
Loving him was red
Oh losing him was blue like I d never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
You never met
Cause loving him was red
Yeah yeah red
Burning red
And that s why he s spinning round in my head
Comes back to me burning red
Yeah yeah
His love was like driving
A new Maserati down a dead end street
I m walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And I ll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I ve loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
And I never saw you coming
And I ll never be the same again
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
And I never saw you coming
And I ll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I ll never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didn t care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me
And he s long gone when he s next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I d never been
Til you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I d never been
Now I m lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
No apologies he ll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn t know that he s the reason why
You re drowning you re drowning you re drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I ll ever be
And now I see now I see now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I d never been
Til you put me down
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I d never been
Now I m lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
And the saddest fear comes creepin in
That you never loved me or her or anyone
or anything yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I d never been
Til you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I d never been
Now I m lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold but something bout it
Felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister s house
And you still got it in your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition
At my wide eyed gaze
We re singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it s long gone
And that magic s not here no more
And I might be okay but I m not fine at all
Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red
Cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses
In a twin size bed
And your mother s telling stories
Bout you on the Tee Ball team
You tell me about your past
Thinking your future was me
And I know it s long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
Hey you called me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all too well
Time won t fly it s like I m paralyzed by it
I d like to be my old self again
But I m still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights
When you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
And I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can t get rid of it cause you remember it all too well
Cause there we are again and I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you ve ever known
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
Down the stairs you were there you remember it all
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don t touch
Out of focus eye of eye
Till the gravity is too much
And I ll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I d be smart to walk away
But you re quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I like it
I can t decide if it s a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
Forever going with the flow but you re friction
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I I I like it
Two headlights shine trough the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the driving and i would
I d follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I I i I i I I i I
Two headlights shine trough the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the driving and I would
follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I I I I I I I I I
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the driving and I would
follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
I ll follow you follow you home
This slope is treacherous
I I I like it
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Yeah
We re happy free confused and lonely at the same time
It s miserable and magical
Oh yeah
Tonight s the night when we forget about the deadlines
It s time
I don t know about you
But I m feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don t know about me
But I bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing
Like we re 22
22
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping
Yeah
We re happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It s miserable and magical
Oh yeah
Tonight s the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It s time
I don t know about you
But I m feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don t know about me
But I bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing
Like we re 22
22
I don t know about you
22
22
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won t be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
I don t know about you
But I m feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don t know about me
But I bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing
Like we re 22
22
Dancing like
22
22
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won t be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
I bet this time of night you re still up
I bet you re tired from a long hard week
I bet you re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I don t
I almost do I almost do
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out there s no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you
That I can t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I don t
I almost do I almost do
We made quite a mess babe
It s probably better off this way
And I confess babe
That in my dreams you re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I don t
I almost do I almost do
I bet this time of night you re still up
I bet you re tired from a long hard week
I bet you re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying this is it I ve had enough
Because like we hadn t seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space what
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear I m gonna change
Trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say I hate you we break up you call me I love you
You called it off again last night
But this time I m telling you
I m telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Like ever
I m really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for a screaming that I m right
And you hide away
And find your piece of mind with some indie record
That s much cooler than mine
You called me up again tonight
But this time I m telling you I m telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say never say never
So he calls me and he s like
I still love you
And I m just like this is exhausting
We are never getting back together
Like ever
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
I m pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That s when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said okay let s talk
And I said
Stay stay stay
I ve been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that it s funny when I m mad mad mad
But I think that it s best if we both stay
Before you I only dated self indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carrying my groceries and now I m always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
Stay stay stay
I ve been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that it s funny when I m mad mad mad
But I think that it s best if we both stay stay stay stay
You took the time to memorize me
My feels my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn t leave
It s been occuring to me
I d like to hang out with you for my whole life
Stay and I ll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad
So I think that it s best if we both stay stay stay stay
Stay stay stay
I ve been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that it s funny when I m mad mad mad
But I think that it s best if we both stay stay stay stay
Stay stay stay
I ve been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that it s funny when I m mad mad mad
But I think that it s best if we both stay
Found myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
Right before your eyes
I m breaking no past
No reasons why
Just you and me
This is the last time I m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better
When right before your eyes
I m aching no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me
This is the last time I m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye
This is the last time you tell me I ve got it wrong
This is the last time I say it s been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time I won t hurt you anymore
Oh oh oh
This is the last time I m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time I m asking you this
this is the last time I m asking you this
Put my name on the top of your list
name on the top of your list
This is the last time I m asking you why
this is the last time I m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
you break my heart
This is the last time I m asking you this
Last time I m asking you
Last time I m asking you
This is the last time I m asking you this
Last time I m asking you this
Last time I m asking you this
Last time I m asking you this
New in town with a made up name in the angel city
Chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen
Another name goes up in lights like diamonds in the sky
And they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
Yeah they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
But can you tell me now you re the lucky one
Now it s big black cars and riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you re lucky
But you re so confused
Cause you don t feel pretty you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you ll make it out alive
And they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
Yeah they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
Can you tell me now you re the lucky one oh oh oh
It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity
And got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over madison square
And it took some time but I understand it now
Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
Let me tell you now you re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you re the lucky one oh oh oh
And they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
Yeah they ll tell you now you re the lucky one
And they ll tell you now you re the lucky one oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn t before
And all I ve seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel right
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you know you know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name everything has changed
All I know is we held the door
You ll be mine and I ll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
But I ll take them down
Take them down and open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach
Is butterflies the beautiful kind
Making up for lost time taking flight
Making me feel right
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you know you know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name everything has changed
All I know is we held the door
You ll be mine and I ll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
I m feeling like I ve missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it s not all in my mind
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you know you know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name everything has changed
All I know is we held the door
You ll be mine and I ll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a newfound brightness
All my days I ll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord it took me away
Back to a first glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems
Like a perfect rhyme
Took off fast through the green light go
Hey skip the conversation and you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we d made
And that was the first day
And darling it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you
And for the first time I had something to lose
Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story s got dust on every page
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
Cause darling it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground
Tonight I m gonna dance for all that we ve been through
But I don t wanna dance if I m not dancing with you
Tonight I m gonna dance like you were in the next room
But I don t wanna dance if I m not dancing with you
It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground
Tonight I m gonna dance for all that we ve been through
But I don t wanna dance if I m not dancing with you
Tonight I m gonna dance like you were in the next room
But I don t wanna dance if I m not dancing with you
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words how little they mean
when they re a little too late
I stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
Good girls hopeful they ll be long we will wait
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
In dreams I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is taking a sweet time erasing you
And you ve got your demons
And darling they all look like me
Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
Distance tire me break down fighting
Silence train runs off his tracks
Kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen
Hang up give up and for the life of us we can t get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic beautiful tragic beautiful
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
I said oh my what a marvellous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we re made of starlight
Like we re made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45
Picks me up play one night at the window
He was 17 and crazy running wild wild
Can t remember what song it was playing
When we walked in
The night we snook into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
I said oh my what a marvellous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Like we re made of starlight starlight
He still look at you worrying so much
About things you can t change
You ll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking away
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Don t you see the starlight starlight
Don t you dream impossible things
Like oh my what a marvellous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Ooh ooh he s talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
Ooh ooh ooh
Oh my what a marvellous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Like we re made of starlight starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don t you see the starlight starlight
Don t you dream impossible things
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn t like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn t get this song
But I do I do
Walked in expecting you d be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don t know how nice that is
But I do
And you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it s strange that you think I m funny cause
He never did
I ve been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don t know why
I m coming off a little shy
But I do
But you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it s strange that you think I m funny cause
He never did
I ve been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time
What s past is past
Cause you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it s strange that you think I m funny cause
He never did
I ve been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
Then on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
You should ve been there
Should ve burst through the door
With that baby I m right here smile
And it would ve felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would ve been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I ve got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I ve been
As I come back through my memory
How you said you d be here
You said you d be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they re all laughing
As I m looking around the room
But there s one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there s something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
he said he d be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they re all laughing
And asking me about you
But there s one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn t show
You should ve been here
And I would ve been so happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they re all standing around me singing
Happy birthday to you
But there s one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Ooh I knew
You call me later
And say I m sorry I didn t make it
And I say I m sorry too
And that was the moment I knew
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
I don t even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what s upstanding and right
It s kinda like a code yeah
And you ve been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey I am no one s exception
This I have previously learned
So don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that oh oh
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you got me alone
And I say
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You re the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it
If I hadn t once been just like her
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that oh oh
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you ve got me alone
And I say
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Call a cab
Lose my number
You re about to lose your girl
Call a cab
Lose my number
Let s consider this lesson learned
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you re coming home
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Don t look at me
You ve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn t once been just like her
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind passionate as sin end so suddenly
Loving him is like tryin a change your mind once you re already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in Autumn so bright just before they lost it all
Losing him was blue like I ve never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite songs
Fighting with him was like tryin a solve a crossword and realizing there s no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you d never find out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I ve never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Burning red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks in echoes
Telling myself it s time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
Burning red
Loving him was red
Oh losing him was blue like I ve never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like tryin a know somebody you never met
‘ Cause loving him was red
We re burning red
And that s why he s spinning round in my head
Comes back to me burning red
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
You said it in a simple way
4am the second day
How strange that I don t know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself don t get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don t wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess you re in New York today
I don t wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would ve played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can t help but wish you took me with you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don t wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess you re in London today
And I don t wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York be here
But you re in London and I break down
Cause it s not fair that you re not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don t wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess you re in New York today
And I don t wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
Oh oh oh oh
I don t wanna miss you like this
Oh oh oh oh
Come back be here
Come back be here
The way you move is like a fool on rainstorm
And I m a house of cards
You re the kinda reckless that should send me running
But I kinda know that I won t get far
And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn t see
What I was thinking of
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that ll hunt me when you re not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me
You re a bad idea
You touch me once and it s really something
You find I m even better than you
Imagined I would be
I m on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it s no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that ll haunt me when you re not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go out
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It s just wrong enough to make you feel right
Lead me up the staircase
Won t you whisper soft and slow
I m captivated by you baby
Like a firework show
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that ll haunt me when you re not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Sparks fly baby smile sparks fly
You with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I m nothing
You with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I m wounded
You pickin on the weaker man
Well you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don t know what you don t know
Someday I ll be living in a big old city
And all you re ever gonna be is mean
Someday I ll be big enough so you can t hit me
And all you re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
You with your switching sides
And your walk by lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don t already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out cause I ll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
You can t lead me down that road
You don t know what you don t know
Someday I ll be living in a big old city
And all you re ever gonna be is mean
Someday I ll be big enough so you can t hit me
And all you re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion but
Nobody s listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can t sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar and pathetic and alone in life
And mean and mean and mean and mean
But someday I ll be living in a big old city
And all you re ever gonna be is mean yeah
Someday I ll be big enough so you can t hit me
And all you re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so
Someday I ll be living in a big old city
And all you re ever gonna be is mean
Someday I ll be big enough so you can t hit me
And all you re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
I m so glad you made time to see me
How s life Tell me how s your family
I haven t seen them in a while
You ve been good busier than ever
We small talk work in the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Cause the last time you saw me
Still burns in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying
I m sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain t nothing but missin you
Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine
And I go back to December turn around
And make it all right
I go back to December all the time
These days I haven t been sleepin
Stayin up playing back myself leavin
When your birthday passed
And I didn t call then I think about summer
All the beautiful times
I watched you laughin from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
With the dark days when the fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying
I m sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain t nothing but missin you
Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine
And I go back to December turn around
And change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms
That September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
If we loved again I swear I d love you right
I d go back in time and change it but I can t
So if the chain is on your door I understand
I said it s too late to apologize it s too late
I said it s too late to apologize it s too late
This is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying
I m sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain t nothing but missin you
Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine
I said you re not sorry no no no noo
You re not sorry no no no noo
You re not sorry no no no noo
I used to think one day we d tell the story of us
How we met and sparks flew instantly
People would say They re the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I m searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I don t even know what page you re on
Oh
A simple complication miscommunication
Has lead to fallout
Too many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can t break through
Now I m standing alone in a crowded room
And we re not speaking
And I m dying to know
Is it killing you like it s killing me
And I don t know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter
How d we end up this way
Se me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you re doing your best to avoid me
I m starting to think one day I ll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should ve held me
Oh
I m scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing
I d tell you I miss you but I don t know how
I ve never heard silence quite this loud
Now I m standing alone in a crowded room
And we re not speaking
And I m dying to know
Is it killing you like it s killing me
And I don t know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle s in your hands now
But I will lay my armor down
If you say you d rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now I m standing alone in a crowded room
And we re not speaking
And I m dying to know
Is it killing you like it s killing me
But I don t know what to say
Since the twist of fate
And it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Now now
And we re not speaking
And I m dying to know
Is it killing you like it s killing me
I don t know what to say
Since the twist of fate
Cause we re going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The End
There s somethin bout the way
The street looks when it s just rained
There s a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Hey ey hey ey ey ey hey ey ey ey
We re drivin down the road
I wonder if you know
I m tryin so hard
not to get caught up now
But you re just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin me want you
And I don t know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don t know why but with you I dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
Hey ey hey ey ey ey hey ey ey ey
So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road
in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here
in this passenger s seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it
Cause I don t know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don t know why but with you I dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
Well I won t hesitate
No more No more
It cannot wait
I m yours
Hey ey hey ey ey ey hey ey ey ey
Cause I don t know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don t know why but with you I dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
Oh oh ooo o
Oh oh ooo o
You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left the small town never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say Can you believe it
As we re lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes yes I can see it now
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man s careful daughter
You are the best thing that s ever been mine
Flash forward and we re taking on the world together
And there is a drawer of my things at your place
You learned my secrets and you figure out why I m guarded
You said we d never make my parents mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes
This is what I thought about
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man s careful daughter
You are the best thing that s ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man s careful daughter
You are the best thing that s ever been mine
Woah oh oo
And I remember that fight 2 30 A M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
And I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause that s all I ve ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I ll never leave you alone
You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you it s like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man s careful daughter
She is the best thing that s ever been mine
Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man s careful daughter
You are the best thing that s ever been mine
Woah oh
Yeah yeah
Do you believe it
Woah oh
We re gonna make it now
Woah oh
And I can see it yeah yeah
And I can see it now see it now see it now
I was ridin shotgun
with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
He s got a one hand feel
on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
he says baby is something wrong
I say nothin
I was just thinkin
how we don t have a song
and he says
Our song is the slammin screen door
sneakin out late tappin on your window
when we re on the phone
and you talk real slow
cause it s late and your mama don t know
Our song is the way you laugh
the first date man I didn t kiss her and I should have
and when I got home
Before I said amen
askin God if He could play it again
I was walkin up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong
had been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway
well on my way
to my lovin bed
I almost didn t notice all the roses and the note that said
Our song is the slammin screen door
sneakin out late tappin on your window
when we re on the phone
and you talk real slow
cause it s late and your mama don t know
Our song is the way you laugh
the first date man I didn t kiss her and I should have
and when I got home
Before I said amen
askin God if He could play it again
I ve heard every album listen to the radio
waitin for something to come along
that was as good as our song
slower
Cause our song is the slammin screen door
sneakin out late tappin on his window
when we re on the phone
and he talks real slow
cause it s late and his mama don t know
Our song is the way he laughs
the first date man I didn t kiss him and I should have
and when I got home
Before I said amen
askin God if He could play it again
play it again
I was riding shotgun
with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and I wrote down our song
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha
Time for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along got him alone and let s hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
I never saw it coming wouldn t have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Chorus
She s not a saint and she s not what you think
She s an actress Whoa
She s better known for the things that she does
on the mattress Whoa
Soon she s gonna find
Stealing other people s toys on the playground
Won t make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge Ha
She lives her life like it s a party and she s on the list
She looks at me like I m a trend and she s so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I m psycho
cause I like to rhyme her name with things but
Sophistication isn t what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn t teach you that in prep school
So it s up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
Chorus
She s not a saint and she s not what you think
She s an actress Whoa
She s better known for the things that she does
on the mattress Whoa
Soon she s gonna find
Stealing other people s toys on the playground
Won t make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge Ha ha
I m just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but haven t you heard
I m just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but I always get the last word
Whoa
Chorus
She s not a saint and she s not what you think
She s an actress Whoa
She s better known for the things that she does
on the mattress Whoa
Soon she s gonna find
Stealing other people s toys on the playground
Won t make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
And do you still feel like you know what you re doing
Cause I don t think you do Oh
Do you still feel like you know what you re doing
I don t think you do I don t think you do
Let s hear the applause
C mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
Cause you re so much better
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
all dressed in pastels
And she is yelling at a brides maid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastery
This is surely not what you d thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Better stand and say
Don t say yes
Run away now
I ll meet you when you re out of the church at the back door
Don t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out and they said speak now
Fun gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song
That sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvided by your lovely bride to be
She floats down the isle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me
Don t you
Don t say yes
Run away now
I ll meet you when you re out of the church at the back door
Don t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out and they said speak now
Don t say yes
Run away now
I ll meet you when you re out at the church at the back door
Don t wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out and they said speak now
Oooooh la la la oh
Oooooh la la la oh
I hear the preacher say
speak now or forever hold your peace
There s the silence
There s my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands
All eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I m only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
So don t say yes
Run away now
I ll meet you in your alt at the church at the back door
Don t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out said speak now
And you say
Lets run away now
I ll meet you in an alt in my tux at the back door
Hey hey I didn t say my vow
So glad you were around when they said speak now
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I d live to see it break
It s getting dark and its all too quiet
And I can t trust anything now
And it s coming over you like it s all a big mistake
Oh holding my breath
Won t lose you again
Something s made your eyes go cold
Come on come on
Don t leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something s gone terribly wrong
You re all I wanted
Come on come on
Don t leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can t breathe whenever you re gone
Can t turn back now
I m haunted
Stood there and watch you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I m wishing he was you instead
Oh holding my breath
Won t see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
Come on come on
Don t leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something s gone terribly wrong
You re all I wanted
Come on come on
Don t leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can t breathe whenever you re gone
Can t turn back now
I m haunted
I know I know
I just know
You re not gone
You can t be gone
No
Come on come on
Don t leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something s gone terribly wrong
Won t finish what you started
Come on come on
Don t leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can t breathe whenever you re gone
Can t go back
I m haunted
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I d see it break
Never thought I d see it
Now he s back in the atmosphere
With drops of jupiter in his hair
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there s a time to change
Since the return of his stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June
But tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the milky way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated
Tell me did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there
Now he s back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation
He checks out mozart while he does tae bo
Reminds me that there s room to grow
Now he s back in the atmosphere
I m afraid that he might think of me as
Plain or jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
And head back to the milky way
And tell me did venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there
Can you imagine no love pride deep fried chicken
Your best friend always stickin up for you
even when I know you re wrong
Can you imagine no first dance
Freeze dried romance
5 hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and Me
But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the milky way
Tell me did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself
Can you imagine no love pride deep fried chicken
Your best friend always stickin up for you
even when I know you re wrong
Can you imagine no first dance
Freeze dried romance
5 hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and Me
Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps praying the floor won t fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
and go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight
Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John I see it all now that you re gone
Don t you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should ve known
Well maybe it s me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it s you and your sick need
to give love then take it away
And you ll add my name to your long list of traitors
who don t understand
And I ll look back and regret how I ignored when
they said Run as fast as you can
Dear John I see it all now that you re gone
Don t you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John I see it all now it was wrong
Don t you think 19 s too young to be played by
Your dark twisted games when I loved you so
I should ve known
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you ve run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don t look now
I m shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town
Dear John I see it all now that you re gone
Don t you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you re gone
Don t you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should ve known
You should ve known
Don t you think I was too young
You should ve known
You re on the phone with your girlfriend
She s upset she s going off about
Something that you said
She doesn t get your humor
Like I do
I m in my room
It s a typical tuesday night
I m listening to the kind of music
She doesn t like
She ll never know your story
Like I do
But she wears short skirts I wear t shirts
She s cheer captain and I m on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you re looking for has been here the whole
time
If you could see
That I m the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can t you see me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walking the streets
With you and your worn out jeans
I can t help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isn t this easy
And you ve got a smile
That could light up this whole town
I haven t seen it in a while
Since she brought you down
You say you re fine
I know you better than that
Hey what are you doing with a girl like that
But she wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She s cheer captain
I m on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
When you wake up and find
That what you re looking for
Has been here the whole time
If you could see
That I m the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can t you
See you belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time
How could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me
Oh I remember you
Driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I m the one who makes you laugh
When you know you re about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it s with me
Can t you see
That I m the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why can t you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time
How could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought
Just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
There I was again tonight forcing laughter faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered have we met
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make it s way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling don t you let it go
I m wonderstruck blushing all the way home
I ll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
2am who do you love
I wonder till I m wide awake
Now I m pacing back and forth wishing you were at my door
I d open up and you would say
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling don t you let it go
I m wonderstruck blushing all the way home
I ll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless don t you let it go
I m wonderstruck dancing around all alone
I ll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don t be in love with someone else
Please don t have somebody waiting on you
Please don t be in love with someone else
Please don t have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling don t you let it go
I m wonderstruck blushing all the way home
I ll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless don t you let it go
I m wonderstruck dancing around all alone
I ll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don t be in love with someone else
Please don t have somebody waiting on you
Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And it s so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you re dreaming
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight
To you everything s funny
You got nothing to regret
I d give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Chorus
Oh darling don t you ever grow up don t you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don t you ever grow up don t you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won t let nobody hurt you
Won t let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up
You re in the car on the way to the movies
And you re mortified your mama s dropping you off
At 14 there s just so much you can t do
And you can t wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots
But don t make her drop you off around the block
Remember she s getting older too
And don t lose the way that you dance around in your
PJs getting ready for school
Chorus
Oh darling don t you ever grow up don t you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don t you ever grow up don t you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
No one s ever burned you
Nothing s ever left you scared
Even though you want to just try to never grow up
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what is sounded like what your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps remember the words said
And all your little brother s favorite songs
I just realized everything I had is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city they just dropped me off
It s so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish I d never grown up
I wish I d never grown up
Oh I don t wanna grow up
Wish I d never grown up
Could still be little
Oh I don t wanna grow up
Wish I d never grown up
It could still be simple
Chorus
Oh darling don t you ever grow up don t you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don t you ever grow up don t you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
Won t let nobody hurt you
Won t let no one break your heart
And even though you want to please try to never grow up
Don t you ever grow up
Just never grow up
I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds and stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming this is absurd
Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I m not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break or fall
Can you take a moment
Promise me this
That you ll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long long live the walls we crashed through
How the candlelight shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I m not afraid
Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
I m so glad you made time to see me
How s life Tell me how s your family
I haven t seen them in a while
You ve been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Cause the last time you saw me
Still burns in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying
I m sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain t nothing but missin you
Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine
And I go back to December turn around
And make it all right
I go back to December all the time
These days I haven t been sleepin
Stayin up playing back myself leavin
When your birthday passed
And I didn t call then I think about summer
All the beautiful times
I watched you laughin from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
With the dark days when the fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying
I m sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain t nothing but missin you
Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine
And I go back to December turn around
And change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms
That September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
If we loved again I swear I d love you right
I d go back in time and change it but I can t
So if the chain is on your door I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying
I m sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain t nothing but missin you
Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around
And make it all right
I go back to December turn around
And change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1 58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go
Away
Away
I do recall now
The smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now I ll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don t know how to be something you miss
Never thought we d have a last kiss
Never imagined we d end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
I do remember
The swing in your step
The life of the party you re showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I m not much for dancing
But for you I did
Because I love your handshake
Meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There s not a day
When I don t miss those rude interruptions
But now I ll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don t know how to be something you miss
Never thought we d have a last kiss
Never imagined we d end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
So I ll watch you live in pictures
Like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it s nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And it s a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and town
But I never planned on you changing your mind
So I ll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don t know how to be something you miss
Never thought we d have a last kiss
Never imagined we d end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last
Guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back
Wasn t it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn t it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you
It s alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh who you are is not where you ve been
You re still an innocent
Still an innocent
Did some things you can t speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn t be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn t it easier in your firefly catching days
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn t it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you
It s alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh who you are is not where you ve been
You re still an innocent
It s okay life is a tough crowd
32 And still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You re still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You ll have new septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to
Be brand new
It s alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh who you are is not where you ve been
You re still an innocent
It s okay life is a tough crowd
32 And still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You re still an innocent
You re still an innocent
Lost your balance on the tight rope
It s never too late to get it back
Elevator buttons and morning air
Stranger silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we d laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs
Seems like there s always someone who disapproves
They ll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury s out my choice is you
Chorus
So don t you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high the water s rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lipgloss smiles
But I don t care
Cause right now you re mine
And you ll say
Chorus
So don t you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high the water s rough
But this love is ours
And it s not theirs to speculate if it s wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong in
I ll fight their doubts and give you faith with this song for you
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father
About your tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours
So don t you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
So don t you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can t take what s ours
They can t take what s ours
The stakes are high the water s rough
But this love is ours
Once upon a time
I believe it was a tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don t feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now you re halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone he still hasn t called
And then you feel so low you can t feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said
Forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when you re here and it rains when you re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
That made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
I looked into you in the eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute
Now I m not so sure
So heres everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
thought I knew for a minute
But I don t anymore
And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you can t feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said
Forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you re here and it rains when you re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn t mean it baby I don t think so
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you re here and it rains when you re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you can t feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said
Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you re here and it rains when you re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn t mean it baby
you said forever and always
I don t think so yeah
Tall dark and supermanly
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It s the same thing to me
He s got his mother s eyes his father s ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say yay
And you smile and say How are you
I say Just fine
I always forget to tell you I love you I love you
Forever
I watch superman fly away
You ve got a busy day today
Go save the world I ll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I ll be with you someday
I ll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
Tall dark and beautiful
He s complicated he s irrational
But I hope someday you ll take me away and save the day yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin
He s not all bad like his reputation
And I can t hear one single word they say
And you ll leave got places to be and I ll be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day
I watch superman fly away
You ve got a busy day today
Go save the world I ll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I ll be with you someday
I ll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don t save some other girl
Don t forget don t forget about me
I m far away but I never let you go
I m lovestruck and looking out the window
Don t forget don t forget where I ll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
Cause I loved you from the very first day
I watch superman fly away
You ve got a busy day today
Go save the world I ll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I ll be with you someday
I ll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
When you come back down
Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I m still reaching
Even though I know you re not there
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
Thinkin bout everything we ve been through
Maybe I ve been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you
Chorus
Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said you re sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you d be here by now
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends were laughing
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I m pacing down the hall
Chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose
Chorus
Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said you re sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you d be here by now
If you re out there if you re somewhere
If you re moving on
I ve being waiting for you ever since you ve been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And I d say
Come back come back come back to me like
You would before you said its not that easy
Before the fight before I locked you out
But I d take it all back now
Chorus
Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said you re sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you d be here by now
You d be here by now
Is that the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby what about the ending
Oh I thought you d be here by now oh ohh ohh ohh
That you d be here by now
Crédito kathgoncalves
Untouchable like
A distant diamond sky
I m reaching out
And I just
Can t tell you why
I m caught up in you
I m caught up in you
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
And when you re close
I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night
When I m in this dream
It s like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that we ll be together
Come on come on
Little taste of heaven
It s half full
And I won t wait here
All day
I know you re saying
That you d be here
Anyway
But you re
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
Now that you re close
I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night
When I m in this dream
It s like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that we ll be together
Come on come on
Oh
In the middle of the night
We could form this dream
I wanna feel you
By my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on come on
Say that we ll be together
Come on come on
Little taste of heaven
I m caught up in you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
And when you re close

Oooh
I like the way you sound in the morning
We re on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can t keep my focus
I watch you talk you didn t notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine I ll shine for you
Whoa I m feeling you baby
Don t be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby I m never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
cause I m gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me I love each freckle on your face
Oh I ve never been so wrapped up honey
I like the way you re everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump
Then fall into me
cause every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine I ll shine for you
Whoa I m feeling you baby
Don t be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby I m never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
cause I m gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall
The bottom s gonna drop out from under our feet
I ll catch you I ll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I ll catch you
The time is gonna come when you re so mad
You could cry
But I ll hold you though the night until you smile
Whoa oh I need you baby
Don t be afraid please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby I m never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
cause I m gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall baby
Jump then fall into me into me into me
Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine I ll shine
And every time you re here baby I ll show you
I ll show you you can
Jump then fall
Jump then fall
Jump then fall
Into me into me
There s somethin bout the way
The street looks when it s just rained
There s a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah
We re drivin down the road
I wonder if you know
I m tryin so hard
not to get caught up now
But you re just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin me want you
And I don t know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don t know why but with you I dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
So baby drive slow
‘ Til we run out of road
in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here
in this passenger s seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it
Cause I don t know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don t know why but with you I d dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I m not usually this way but
You pull me in and I m a little more brave
It s the first kiss
It s flawless
Really something
It s fearless
Oh yeah
And I don t know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don t know why but with you I would dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
Cause I don t know how
it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don t know why but with you I would dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
Oh oh
oh yeah
I could go back to every laugh
But I don t want to go there anymore and I
know all the steps up to your door
But I don t want to go there anymore
Talk to the wind
talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
Chorus
I ll leave my window open
Cause I m too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I m right here hoping
That you ll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don t wanna have to go that far and I
I ve got you down I know you by heart
And you don t even know where I start
Talk to yourself
Talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
Don t wait for the sky to clear
Chorus
I ll leave my window open
Cause I m too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I m right here hoping
That you ll come in with the rain
I ve watched you so long
screamed your name
I don t know what else
I can say
But I ll leave my window open
Cause I m too tired tonight
for all these games
Just know I m right here hoping
You ll come in with the rain
I could go back to every laugh
But I don t want to go there anymore
This is wrong but
I can t help but feel like
There ain t nothin more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can t
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I d be breaking all my roles to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name
So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I can t take my eyes off of you
I m no one special just another wide eyed girl
Who s desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
Morning loneliness
Comes around when I m not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You ll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face I d be
Counting down the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name
So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I can t take my eyes off of you
I m no one special just another wide eyed girl
Who s desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
You played in bars you play guitar
And I m invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you ll never see you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio
So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I can t take my eyes off of you
I m no one special just another wide eyed girl
Who s desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
Sweet sweet superstar
Superstar
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It s the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain t seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody s way
It s your freshman year and you re gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys
Will wink at you and say
You know I haven t seen you around before
chorus
Cause when you re fifteen
And somebody tells you they love you
You re gonna believe them
And when you re fifteen feeling like
There s nothing to figure out
Well count to ten take in
This is life before you know who you re gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you re best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they re so cool
We ll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you re on you re very first date
And he s got a car and you re feeling like flying
And you re mama s waiting up
And you re thinking he s the one
And you re dancing round your room
When the night ends
When the night ends
chorus
Cause when you re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You re gonna believe them
When you re fifteen
And your first kiss makes your head spin round
But in your life you ll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn t know it at fifteen
When all you wanted
Was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried
chorus
Cause when you re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You re gonna believe them
And when you re fifteen
Don t forget to look before you fall
I ve found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you re supposed to be
I didn t know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
We were both young
When I first saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I m standing there
On a balcony in summer air
I see the lights
See the party the ball gowns
I see you make your way
Through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Beggin you Please don t go
And I said
Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I ll be waiting
All that s left to do is run
You ll be the Prince
And I ll be the Princess
It s a Love Story
Baby just say Yes
So I sneak out
To the garden to see you
We keep quiet
Cause we were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were Romeo
I was a Scarlett Letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
And I was beggin you Please don t go
And I said
Romeo take me
Somewhere we can be alone
I ll be waiting
All that s left to do is run
You ll be the Prince
And I ll be the Princess
It s a Love Story
Baby just say Yes
Romeo save me
They re trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult
But it s real
Don t be afraid
We ll make it out of this mess
It s a Love Story
Baby just say Yes
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin if you were ever comin around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said
Romeo save me
I ve been feelin so alone
I keep waiting for you
But you never come
Is this in my head
I don t know what to think
He knelt to the ground
And pulled out a ring
And said
Marry me Juliet
You ll never have to be alone
I love you
And that s all I really know
I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress
It s a Love Story
Baby just say Yes
Oh oh
Oh oh oh
Cause we were both young
When I first saw you
In the heat of the a fight
I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying make me stay
I said this time I ve had enough
And you ve called a hundred times
But I m not pickin up
cause I m so mad
I might tell you that it s over
But if you look a little closer
I said leave
But all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming I m in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain
Come back for more
And don t you leave
cause I know all I need
Is on the other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride
Sittin here alone
Going through the photographs
Staring at the phone
I keep going back over
Things we both said
And I remember the slammin door
And all the things that I misread
Baby you know everything
Tell me why you couldn t see
That when I left I wanted you to
Chase after me
I said leave
But all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming I m in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain
Come back for more
And don t you leave
cause I know all I need
Is on the other side of the door
And I scream out the window
I can t even look at you I don t need you
But I do I do I do
I ll say there s nothing you can say
To make right again I mean it
I mean it
What I mean is
I said leave
But baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming I m in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain
Come back for more
And don t you leave
cause I know all I need
Is on the other side of the door
With your face and your beautiful eyes
And the conversation
With the little white lies
And the faded picture
Of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car
Up the stairs
And I m broke down cryin
Was she worth this mess
After everything in that little black dress
After everything I must confess
I need you
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people
And sometimes we change our minds
But it s killing me to see you go after all this time
MM mm mm
MM mm mm mm mm
Music starts playin like the end of a sad movie
It s the kind of ending you don t really wanna see
Cause it s tragedy and it ll only bring you down
Now I don t know what to be without you around
And we know it s never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
You re the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can t breathe without you
But I have to breathe without you
But I have to
Never wanted this never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people
And sometimes it doesn t work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
And we know it s never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
You re the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can t breathe without you
But I have to breathe without you
But I have to
It s two A M
Feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it s not easy easy for me
It s two A M
Feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain t easy easy for me
And we know it s never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Ohh and I can t breathe without you
But I have to breathe without you
But I have to breathe without you
But I have to
I m sorry I m sorry I m sorry
I m sorry I m sorry I m sorry
Say you re sorry
That face of an angel comes out
Just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth
All this time cause
I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl I should ve known I should ve known
I m not a princess
This ain t a fairytale
I m not the one you sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain t hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it s too late for you and your white horse to come around
Maybe I was naive got lost in your eyes
I never really had a chance
My mistake I didn t know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings now I know
I m not a princess
This ain t a fairytale
I m not the one you sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain t hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse to come around
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I m so sorry
Cause I m not your princess
This ain t a fairytale
I m gonna find someone some day
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world
That was a small town there in my rearview mirror
Disappearing now
And it s too late for you and your white horse
Now it s too late for you and your white horse to
Catch me now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Try and catch me now ohh
Its too late
To catch me now
Hey Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
As we walked we were talking and
I didn t say half the things I wanted to
Of all those girls tossing rocks at your window
I ll be the one waiting there even when it s cold
Hey sthephen boy you might have me believing
I don t always have to be alone
cause I can t help it if you look like an angel
Can t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I ve been feeling since I met you
Can t help it if there s no one else
I can t help myself
Hey Stephen I ve been holding back this feeling
So I ve got some things to say to you
I seen it all so I thought
That I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk way you talk way you say my name
It s beautiful wonderful don t you ever change
Hey stephen while people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same
cause I can t help it if you look like an angel
Can t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I ve been feeling since I met you
Can t help it if there s no one else
I can t help myself
They re dimming the streets lights
You re perfect for me why aren t you here tonight
I m waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near
Shine shine shine
Hey stephen I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls well they re beautiful
But would they write a song for you
I can t help it if you look like an angel
Can t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I ve been feeling since I met you
Can t help it if there s no one else
I can t help myself
If you look like an angel
Can t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic
I ve been feeling since I met you
Can t help it if there s no one else
I can t help myself
Myself I can t help myself
I can t help myself
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I ve been giving out chances everytime and all you do is let me down
And its taking me this long baby but I figured you out
And you think it will be fine again but not this time around
You don t have to call anymore
I won t pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don t want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you re sorry
But I don t believe you baby like I did before
You re not sorry no no no no
Lookin so innocent
I might believe you if I didn t know
Could a loved you all my life
If you hadn t left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I m tired of being last to know
And now you re asking me to listen
Cuz its worked each time before
But you don t have to call anymore
I won t pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don t want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you re sorry
But I don t believe you baby like I did before
You re not sorry no no no noo
You re not sorry no no no noo
You had me calling for you honey
And it never would ve gone away no
You use to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade
So you don t have to call anymore
I won t pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There s nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you re sorry
But I won t believe you baby like I did before
You re not sorry no no no noo
You re not sorry no no no noo
And it s a sad picture
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
You know it s all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history and you re getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I ll do anything to see it through
Chorus
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
We ll sing hallelujah
We ll sing hallelujah
Oh
So we ve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It s hard to fight when the fight ain t fair
We re getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we re faster and never scared
You can walk away say we don t need this
But there s something in your eyes
Says we can beat this
Chorus
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
We ll sing hallelujah
We ll sing hallelujah
Oh
Chorus
Bridge final chorus
Tonight we ll stand get off our knees
Fight for what we ve worked for all these years
And the battle was long it s the fight of our lives
But we ll stand up champions tonight
It was the night we changed
Do you see it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It s a revolution throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we ll sing hallelujah
We sang hallelujah
Hallelujah
He is sensible and
So incredible and
All my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear
And it s like
I couldn t ask for anything better
He opens up my door
And I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
CHORUS
But I miss screaming and fighting
And kissing in the rain
And it s 2 am and I m cursing your name
You re so in love that you act insane
And that s the way I loved you
Breakin down and coming undone
It s a roller coaster
Kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that s the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He s close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He s charming and endearing and I m
Comfortable
CHORUS
But I miss screaming and fighting
And kissing in the rain
And it s 2 am and I m cursing your name
You re so in love that you act insane
And that s the way I loved you
Breakin down and coming undone
It s a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that s the way I loved you
He can t see the smile I m faking
And my heart s not breaking
Cause I m not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
CHORUS
I ll miss screaming and fighting
And kissing in the rain
It s 2 am and I m cursing your name
I m so in love that I acted insane
And that s the way I loved you
Breakin down and coming undone
It s a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that s the way I loved you oh oh
And that s the way I loved you oh oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that s the way I loved you
I m five years old
It s getting cold
I ve got
My big coat on
I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch
The tractor rides
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home
I don t know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you re not scared of anything at all
don t know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today
I m thirteen now
And don t know how my friends
Could be so mean
I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys
And we drive and drive
Until we found a town
Far enough away
And we talk and window shop
Until I forgot all their names
I don t know who I m gonna talk to
Now at school
But I know I m laughing on the car ride home with you
don t know how long it s gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today
I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He s better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And youre talking to me
It s the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarves
Daddy s smart
And you re the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine
And I didn t know if you knew
So I m taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it s something I just fell into
And it was over rated
But just look what I ve created
I came out alive but I m black and blue ue
Before you ask me if I m alright
Think about what I
Had to do oo yeah
Wake up and smell the break up
Fix my heart put on my make up
Another mess I didn t plan
And I ll bet you thought you d beat me
Wish you could only see
I ve got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
I d be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can t believe you made me
Sit at home and cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night
And now you ask about you and I
There s no you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to
Wake up and smell the break up
Fix my heart put on my make up
Another mess I didn t plan
And I ll bet you thought you d beat me
I wish you d could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
And when you re home alone at night
You ll still wonder
Why you took everything I had oh baby
I had a lot about you and I
There s no you and I
And I know
Someday you will
Wake up and smell the break up
Realize that we won t make up
It didn t go the way you planned
And you ll know you didn t beat me
When you look down and see
I ve got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark yeah
Written on the back of my hand
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I have painted pictures in the sky
But sometimes we don t say a thing
Just listen to the crickest sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don t want to live without you
I m only up when you re not down
Don t wanna fly if you re still on the ground
It s like no matter what I do
Well it drives me crazy half the time
The other half
I m only trying to let you know
That what I feel is true
and I m only me when I m with you
Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn t true
I m not on trying to hide my tears
The secret s on my deepest fears
Do it oh nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can t live without me
I m only up when you re not down
Don t wanna fly if you re still on the ground
It s like no matter what I do
Well it drives me crazy half the time
The other half
I m only trying to let you know
That what I feel is true
and I m only me when I m with you
When I m with anybody else
is so hard to be myself
and only you can tell
That I m only up when you re not down
Don t wanna fly if you re still on the ground
It s like no matter what I do
Well it drives me crazy half the time
The other half
I m only trying to let you know
That what I feel is true
and I m only me when I m with you
And I m only me
Who I wanna be
Well I m only me when I m with you
With You
Ohohoh yeah
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don t know why
I wanna be somewhere
Where you are
I wanna be where
You re here
Your eyes are lookin into mine
So baby make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I m lookin through your
I m lookin through your eyes
I wake up I m alive
In only a little while
I ll cry
Cause you re my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight
Cause I
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where
You re here
Your eyes are lookin into mine
So baby make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I m lookin through your
I m lookin through your eyes
Just as long as your mine
I ll be your everything tonight
let me love you kiss you
Baby let me miss you
Let me see your
dream about
dream about
dream about your eyes
eyes
eyes
beautiful eyes
It s strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles the flowers everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong
You say that you d take it all back given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
You should ve said no you should ve gone home
You should ve thought twice before you let it all go
You should ve know that word but what you did with her
Would get back to me
And I should ve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn t be asking myself why
You shouldn t be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should ve said no baby and you might still have me
You can see that I ve been crying
And baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same
You say that the past is the past you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
You should ve said no you should ve gone home
You should ve thought twice before you let it all go
You should ve know that word but what you did with her
Would get back to me
And I should ve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn t be asking myself why
You shouldn t be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should ve said no baby and you might still have me
I can t resist before you go tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this
No no no no
You should ve said no you should ve gone home
You should ve thought twice before you let it all go
You should ve know that word but what you did with her
Would get back to me
And I should ve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn t be asking myself why
You shouldn t be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should ve said no baby and you might still have me
State the obvious
I didn t get my perfect fantasy
I realized you love yourself
More than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends
That I m obsessive and crazy
That s fine you won t mind
If I say
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You re a redneck heartbreak
Who s really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I m concerned
You re just another picture to burn
There s no time for tears
I m just sittin here plannin
my revenge
There s nothing stopping me
From goin out with all of
your best friends
And if you come around sayin sorry to me
My daddy s gonna show you
How sorry you ll be
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You re a redneck heartbreak
Who s really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I m concerned
You re just another picture to burn
And if you re missin me
You better keep it to yourself
Cause comin back around here
Would be bad for your health
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You re a redneck heartbreak
Who s really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven t heard
I really really hate
That stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You re a redneck heartbreak
Who s really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I m concerned
You re just another picture to burn
Burn burn burn
Baby burn
Just another picture to burn
Baby burn
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won t see
What I want and I need
Everything that we should be
I ll bet she s beautiful
That girl he talks about
and she s got everything
that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh cuz its just so damn funny
But I can t even see
anyone when he s with me
He says he s so in love
he s finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
he s all I think about at night
He s the reason for the tear drops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He s the song in the car I keep singing
don t know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can t breathe
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight
give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes
and know she s lucky cuz
He s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He s the song in the car I keep singing
Don t know why I do
So I drive home alone
as I turn out the light
I ll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight
cuz he s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one that s got enough of me to break my heart
He s the song in the car I keep singing
don t know why I do
He s the time taken up
but there s never enough
And he s all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won t see
Santa Baby
Slip a sable under the tree
For me
I ve been an awful good girl
Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby
A fifty four convertable too
Light blue
I ll wait up for you dear
Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I ve missed
Think of all the boys I haven t kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list
Santa baby
I want a yacht and really that s not a lot
I ve been an angel all year
Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa honey
There s one more thing I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany s
I really do believe in you
Let s see if you believe in me
Santa baby
Forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don t mean on the phone
Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I ll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me
Well it s been a year it doesn t surprise me
Merry Christmas
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying \ I love you \ I meant it
Now I know what a fool I ve been
But if you kissed me now I know you d fool me again
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I ll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I ll give it to someone special
Special
Yea yea
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I m hiding from you and your soul of ice
I thought you were someone to rely on
Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl under cover but you tore me apart
Maybe this year maybe this year
I ll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I ll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I ll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I ll give it to someone special
I ll give it to someone special
Please take down the mistletoe
Cause I don t want to think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
Mama s in the kitchen worrying about me
Season s greeetings
hope you re well
Well I m doing alright if you were wondering
Lately I can never tell
I know this shouldn t be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine
I ve been doing fine without you really
Up until the night s got cold
And everybody s here except you
Baby seems like everyone s got someone to hold
But for me it s just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Merry Christmas everybody
It ll have to be something I just say this year
I bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands
I know this shouldn t be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn t wonder
How you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
You were mine
I m dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I m dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I m dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ the savior is born christ the savior is born
Silent night holy night
Son of god love s pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy place
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus lord at thy birth
Jesus lord at thy birth
Alleluia
Alleluia
Alleluia
Alleluia
Christ the savior is born
What if ribbons and bows didn t mean a thing
Would the song stil survive without 5 golden rings
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
What would happen if God never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas Carols told a lie
Tell me what you would find
You d say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here s to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It s something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here s something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wish they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
Then I d think there was something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away
Tell me what would you find
You d say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here s to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It s something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here s something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
100 mile an hour lives
And it s this time of year
And everybody s here
It seems the last thing on your mind
You d say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here s to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It s something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here s something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
There s gotta be more
There s gotta be more
I didn t know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason I know
I didn t read between the lines
And baby I ve got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right
chorus
So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this ain t the best view
On the outside looking in
I ve been a lot of lonely places
I ve never been on the outside
You saw me there but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this a part of you
And now it s all too late so you see
You could ve helped if you have wanted to
But no one notices until it s too
Late to do anything
chorus
So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this ain t the best view
On the outside looking in
I ve been a lot of lonely places
I ve never been on the outside
How can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you this ain t the best view
On the outside looking in
I ve been a lot of lonely places
I ve never been on the outside
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said That s a lie
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer d gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think That little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin God that you weren t here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It s hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin back on all of that it s nice to believe
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think That little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
And I m back for the first time since then
I m standin on your street
And there s a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you ll read is
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you ll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think That little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh think of me
Mmmm
You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said That s a lie
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel somethin
And you do what you want cause I m not what you wanted
Oh what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I m sittin here thinkin it through
I ve never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there lovin you and washed them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I m sittin here thinkin it through
I ve never been anywhere cold as you
You never did give a damn thing honey
But I cried cried for you
And I know you wouldn t have told nobody if I died
Died for you
Oh what a shame
What a rainy ending give to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counted all the scars you made
Now that I m sittin here thinkin it through
I ve never been anywhere cold as you
I don t know what I want so don t ask me
Cause I m still trying to figure it out
Don t know what s down this road I m just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I m not the only one
Who feels the way I do
I m alone on my own and that s all I know
I ll be strong I ll be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh I m just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on my old blue jeans
And I m wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow s just a mistery oh yeah
But that s ok
I m alone on my own and that s all I know
I ll be strong I ll be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh I m just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Maybe I m just a girl on a mission
But I m ready to fly
I m alone on my own and that s all I know
I ll be strong I ll be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh I m alone on my own and that s all I know
Oh I m just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Oh I m just a girl
oh I m just a girl
oh oh
oh I m just a girl
Cory s eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it s like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words nobody knows
There s pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as he s walking home
Saying does he know
Will you ever know
chorus
You re beautiful
Every little piece love don t you know
You re really gonna be someone ask anyone
When you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it don t stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I m taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It s hard to make conversation
When he s taking my breath away
I should say hey by the way
chorus
You re beautiful
Every little piece love don t you know
You re really gonna be someone ask anyone
When you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it don t stay beautiful
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I ll never get to hold at least you ll know
You re beautiful
Every little piece love don t you know
You re really gonna be someone ask anyone
When you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh but if it don t do you stay beautiful
Beautiful beauti ful beautiful beauti ful
Ohh la la la
Ohhh ohhhh
Oh but if you don t stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you d beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids you and I
Oh my my my my
I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn t that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we d really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A M riding in your truck
and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside til the morning light
Oh my my my my
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me got down on one knee
Take me back to the time
when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We ll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time you and I
I ll be eighty seven you ll be eighty nine
I ll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky oh my my my
Seems the only one who doesn t see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you re not pretty
But that s not true cause i know you
chorus
Hold on baby you re losing it
The water s high you re jumping into it
And letting go and no one knows
You cry but you don t tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you re tied together with a smile
But you re coming undone
I guess it s true that love was all you wanted
Cause you re giving it away like it s extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh cause it s not his price to pay
Not his price to pay
chorus
Hold on baby you re losing it
The water s high you re jumping into it
And letting go and no one knows
You cry but you don t tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you re tied together with a smile
But you re coming undone
You re tied together with a smile
But you re coming undone oh
Goodbye baby
Goodbye baby
With a smile baby baby
