One two three four
Ooh ooh
Every time you come around you know I can t say no
Every time the sun goes down I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight I had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin this will be the last but it probably won t
I got nothin left to lose or use or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I ll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah I was lookin for a way out now I can t escape
Nothin happens aftеr two it s true it s true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
My bad habits lеad to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin over everything to reach the first time s spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin this will be the last but it probably won t
I got nothin left to lose or use or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I ll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah I was lookin for a way out now I can t escape
Nothin happens after two it s true it s true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We took the long way round
And burned til the fun ran out now
My bad habits lead to late nights endin alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin this will be the last but it probably won t
I got nothin left to lose or use or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I ll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah I was lookin for a way out now I can t escape
Nothin happens after two it s true it s true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
My bad habits lead to you
I have grown up I am a father now
Everything has changed but I am still the same somehow
You know I ve never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven t happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind I should cut it down
I still know people I don t like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed bout the things that I did in my youth
Cause now I have a child I know one day that you will do
Freight cargo dot stops and aeroplanes
Late night calls signal is in and out again
Feelin low serotonin known better days
Go go go But every moment you re here with me
Timе stops to still
When you are in my arms it always will
And life lifе is changin tides
I lost the confidence in who I was
To busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I ve broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I have no regrets but wish I did things in a different way
Low fly zone lawsuits and film stars
Headline wrote the princess and the face scar
Broken bones break ins and Babylon
Go go go But every moment you re here with me
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms it always will
And life life is changin tides
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms it always will
And life life is changin tides
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that taste like yours
Strawberries and somethin more
Ooh yeah I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar ooh
Fill up the engines we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh yeah I want it all mm
Ooh you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I m
Like my soul s on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night mm
Yeah you got me singing like
Ooh I love it when you do it like that
And when you re close up give me thе shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance til the sunlight cracks
And whеn they say the party s over then we bring it right back
And we say ooh I love it when you do it like that
And when you re close up give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party s over then we bring it right back
Into the car on the back seat in the moon lit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh I can t get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh I can t get enough
Ooh you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I m
Like my soul s on fire

If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I m away
We ll see the same sky tonight
But the stars are out of place
You ll never know the weight of my heart
Every time I leave you babe
It s hard to break the landing
But I ll see you again
I m never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I m miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love will keep alive
I m never gonna leave your life
I I I m I m never gonna leave your life
Oh I could never tell you lie
Or put in words your finest traits
The darkest green and hazel eyes
And yet I can t describe the shade
You are all this heart of mine
And there you will remain
You ll never know the weight of my
Decisions when I leave your smiling face
It s hard to understand it
But I ll see you again
Oh I m I m never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I m miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love will keep alive
I m never gonna leave your life
I I I m I m never gonna leave your life
It s hard to break the landing
But I ll see you again
I m never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I m miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love will keep alive
I m never gonna leave your life
I I I m I m never gonna leave your life
If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I m away
I thought it d feel different playin Wembley
Eighty thousand singin with me
It s what I ve been chasin cause this is the dream
When it was all over I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers just me and you
Then we started talking the way that we do
Ain t it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
Little moments that pass us by
Oh but I remember
The first kiss the first night the first song that made you cry
The first drink red wine on a step in Brooklyn I
Still feel the first fight and we both made it out alive
And I can t wait to make a million more first times
MM mm
The greatest thing that I have achieved
Was four little words down on one knee
You said Darling are you jokin and I just said Please
Ain t it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
Little moments that pass us by
Oh but I remember
The first kiss the first night the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said I love you I
Can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can t wait to make a million more first times
MM mm
Ain t it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
Little moments that pass us by
Oh but I remember
The first kiss first night first song that made you cry
First dance in moonlight in your parents garden I
Can t wait to see everything that s yet to be
Our first child and then a million more first times
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn t that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess
That just keeps us depressed
We forget that we re here right now
Cause we re livin life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on you re bound to break
Something s got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn
If we re missin out on what the people think is right
Seein through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lucid conversation for the message that you ll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then
We ll go all night
Two steppin with the woman I love
All my troubles turnin up
And when I m on your eyes electrified
We ll keep turnin up and go all night
Oh we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low
Then up alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night night
Two steppin with the woman I love
Night yeah
All we need is us
What do you reckon is it just me
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence it tends to come
When I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don t see it you should trust me
I feel like I ve got nothin left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin like the best and the rest are just less
Then she needs so we press play and step to the beat
Cause we re livin life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on you re bound to break
Something s got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays and
We ll go all night
Two steppin with the woman I love
All my troubles turnin up
And when I m on your eyes electrified
We ll keep turnin up and go all night
Oh we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low
Then up alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night night
Two steppin with the woman I love
Night yeah
All we need is us
Night night
Two steppin with the woman I love
Night yeah
All we need is us to go all night
How was I to know It s a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be
The road that was broken brought us together
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would givе you a diamond ring
When I folded you saw the bеst in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen
Oh yeah we ve been in the rain
Been on the rocks but we found our way
We ve ordered pizza to an aeroplane
Slept on the beach like we were castaways
We ve been in the storm
Been to an Irish bar in central Rome
Driven to hospitals with broken bones
We ve shared a toothbrush and shared our home
We ve seen the moon reflect on the rollin tide
Been up at 5AM watchin the sunrise
Becausе the world looks better whеn I m by your side
Oh I oh I oh I
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah you bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah you bring me to life
You bring me to life
We ve been on the road
We ve watched the blossom fall to Earth like snow
Fumbled in cubicles in Tokyo
And been to funerals in rented clothes
MM we drank your father s whiskey
When your grandma died
You brought me to the morning through my darkest night
Yeah the world hurts less when I m by your side
Oh I oh I oh I
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah you bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah you bring me to life
You bring me to life
Head first collidin
Dreamers collidin
Universe collidin
Your love let the light in
Head first collidin
Dreamers collidin
Universe collidin
We made love in the sky
Overslept and missed the Northern Lights
You lost your wedding ring but I didn t mind
‘ Cause I got a feeling baby we ll be fine
This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on to rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration hip hip hooray love
Photographs in sepia tones
It s so still the fire s barely fighting the cold alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I m almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it s worth
We ll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I ll remember the way we were you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby you will never be lost on me
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it or leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can t replace us or even erase us
The car was stuck the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we d ever known
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it s worth
We ll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I ll remember the way we were you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
Baby you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
Well I will always love you for what it s worth
We ll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I ll remember the way we were you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby you will never be lost on me
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Lost on me
Oh graffiti on the overpass
You were loved before you had arrived
And every day that love just multiplies
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby
And Mumma made the mobile in the sky
And loving you is easy
But life will not always be
Fall into the world of your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong
Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb s tail we ll go
Yeah be still now and close your eyes
And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet my child
Hanging out with the sandman
And though there s rain outside you ll bе warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won t hurt you now
So go to sleep my lovе
Hanging out with the sandman
Chocolate covered roof and candy cars
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields we ll fly
We ll count the fish in the sky
Honeybees and birds sing your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong
Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb s tail we ll go
Yeah be still now and close your eyes
And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet my child
Hanging out with the sandman
And though there s rain outside you ll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won t hurt you now
So go to sleep my love
Hanging out with the sandman
Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb s tail we ll go
Yeah be still now and close your eyes
And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet my child
Hanging out with the sandman
And though there s rain outside you ll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won t hurt you now
So go to sleep my love
Hanging out with the sandman
We re hanging out with the sandman
We re hanging out with the sandman
We re hanging out with the sandman
Another human cloud to bring you down when you blew the last away
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown but for me they look the same
Sometimes it can get all too much for me
And that s why the photograph gets burned throw the match in gasoline a ayy
Don t let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day
You cannot stop the rain no way
Holdin an umbrella when the rain clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin real but it s not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind you got no one to blame
But that s just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain yeah yeah yeah yeah
You cannot stop the rain yeah yeah yeah yeah
Another I me mine to blur the lines between love and then heartbreak
Oh it s a lonely life thinkin you re right and always shiftin blame
And every time it s getting more and more ugly
And that s why the photograph gets burned throw the match in gasoline a ayy
Don t let them tell you Keep it all inside
I know the winds have got to change
You cannot stop the rain no way
Holdin an umbrella when the rain clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin real but it s not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind you got no one to blame
But that s just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain yeah yeah yeah yeah
You cannot stop the rain yeah yeah yeah yeah
And it seem like time
Can be so much more than a wake up call into live real life
Every day is a chance that we can start over read my mind
There ll be ups and downs but it won t change a thing between you and I
There s one thing I can t change
You cannot stop the rain no way
Holdin an umbrella when the rain clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin real but it s not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind you got no one to blame
But that s just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain no way
Holdin an umbrella when the rain clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin real but it s not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind you got no one to blame
But that s just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain yeah yeah yeah yeah
You cannot stop the rain yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can t stop the rain yeah can t stop the rain yeah Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can t stop the rain can t stop the rain Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can t stop the rain Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You know you can t stop the rain yeah yeah yeah yeah
It s been a while since we ve been alone
To turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you re beautiful
Cause it s been a while and I apologize
I just get caught up in the rat race I m runnin
Chasin a moment I m hoping is comin
If I stopped and took a look around
It s in front of my eyes eyes
Baby let s slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darling that dress reminds
Me of the first time
And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
It s been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends too many evening drinks
Yeah we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves and I apologize
Sometimes you re sad and you tell me it s nothin
And I brush it off because there s always somethin
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritize ize
If there s one thing I know it s this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss
And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
Wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
In slow motion
In slow motion
I wish that heaven
Had visiting hours
So I could just show up
And bring the news
That she s getting older
And I wish that you d met her
The things that she ll learn from me
I got them all from you
Can I just stay a while and we ll put all the world to rights
The little ones will grow and I ll still drink your favourite wine
And soon they re going to close but I ll see you another day
So much has changed since you ve been away
Well I wish that heaven
Had visiting hours
So I could just swing by
And ask your advice
What would you do in my situation
I haven t a clue how I d even raise them
What would you do
Cause you always do what s right
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear
I d tell you that I m scared of turning out a failure
You d say Remember that the answer s
In the love that we create
So much has changed since you ve been away
I wish that heaven
Had visiting hours
And I would ask them
If I could take you home
But I know what they d say
That it s for the best
So I would live life the way you told me
And make it on my own
And I will close the door but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are

Stayin up in every city s Holiday Inn
If it wasn t here then I was at the couch of a friend s
Wetherspoon s was an easy option

Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid always dismissed quick
Stick to singing stop rapping like it s Christmas
And if you re talkin money
Then my conversation s shifting
My dreams are bigger than just bein on the rich list
Might be insanity but people call it gifted
My face is goin numb
From the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in this song might get twisted
My wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick
I m a private guy and you know nothin bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes I must have missed them
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it s eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good
Well then I m better today
But it s ironic how you people thought
I d never be great
I like my shows open air Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got

You sleep on me
Cause you re only fucking with me in your dreams
Not even when I m on my deathbed

And her lips upon mine

Used to be two hearts in love
Oh why oh why am I alone
Did I did I do something wrong
Am I the reason or have you found someone else
So tell me girl
How can I live without love
How can I be what you want
Cause when the morning comes around
You re still gone and I ll say
How can I see through the dark
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else s arms
Well that s the way to break my
Heart
That s the way to break my heart
That s the way to break my heart
That s the way to break my heart
That s the way to break my —
First love never dies
Guess I ll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There s just one thing I remember
Her lips upon mine
So soft feelings I don t know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love
Oh why oh why am I alone
Did I did I do something wrong
Am I the reason or have you found someone else
So tell me girl
How can I live without love
How can I be what you want
Cause when the morning comes around
You re still gone and I ll say
How can I see through the dark
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else s arms
Well that s the way to break my
Heart
That s the way to break my heart
That s the way to break my heart
That s the way to break my heart
That s the way to break my —
That s the —
That s the —
That s the —
Did I did I
That s the —
That s the —
That s the way to break my —
The club isn t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I ll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I m singing like
Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don t mind me
Say boy let s not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead
I m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I m in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I m in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I m in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I m in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We re going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I m singing like
Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don t mind me
Say boy let s not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume
Of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I ve not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I ve grown
But I can t wait to go home
I m on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel and it s real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields
And getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don t reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then take me back to when
We found weekend jobs when we got paid
We d buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh how we ve grown
But I can t wait to go home
I m on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel and it s real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One s brother overdosed
One s already on his second wife
One s just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can t wait to go home
And I m on my way I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel it s real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another s arms
Only a month we ve been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah you look happier you do
Ain t nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain t nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal baby
If you re moving on with someone new
Cause baby you look happier you do
My friends told me one day I ll feel it too
And until then I ll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Sat on the corner of the room
Everything s reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle
And telling myself you re happier
Aren t you
Ain t nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain t nobody need you like I do
I know that there s others that deserve you
But my darling I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier you do
My friends told me one day I ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Baby you look happier you do
I knew one day you d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I ll be waiting here for you
I was born inside a small town
I ve lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord s house
But stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon
They kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy
When they should be filled with pride
And when the world s against me
Is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me
I try to take it in my stride
You know that I ve got whisky
With white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point
I know without it s no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead I look in the mirror questioning what I ve become
Guess it s a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine to five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Showed me the locked doors
I find another use for the key
And you ll see
I m well aware of certain things
That can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own so here I ll stay
Save your lovin arms for a rainy day
And I ll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
I used to think that nothing could be better
Than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life
I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed they break as well
And ain t nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you re living your dream
Man this shit should be fun
Please know that I m not trying to preach
Like I m Reverend Run
I beg you don t be disappointed
With the man I ve become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I ve gotta chase those dreams
Now I m playing for the people Dad and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien s proud
And to the next generation inspiration s allowed
The world may be filled with hate
But keep erasing it now
Somehow
I m well aware of certain things
That will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own so here I ll stay
Save your lovin arms for a rainy day
And I ll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I ll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I ll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I ve been away
But where I m heading who knows
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I ve been away
But where I m heading who knows
My pain eraser
And I ll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I ll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I ll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
Oh maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I ve been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
So don t call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don t tell me you need me
If you don t believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You re a mystery
I have travelled the world
There s no other girl like you
No one what s your history
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on
Cause I heard you do mmh
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I ve been known to give my all
And lie awake every day
Don t know how much I can take
So don t call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don t tell me you need me
If you don t believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I ve been known to give my all
Sitting back looking at
Every mess that I made
So don t call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don t tell me you need me
If you don t believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in
and follow my lead
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh I never knew you were
The someone waiting for me
Cause we were just kids
When we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you re holding mine
Baby I m dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it darling
You look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman stronger
Than anyone I know
She shares my dreams
I hope that someday I ll share her home
I found a love to carry
More than just my secrets
To carry love to carry
children of our own
We are still kids
But we re so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we ll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand
Be my girl I ll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby I m dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don t deserve this darling
You look perfect tonight
Baby I m dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect I don t deserve this
You look perfect tonight
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said Baby I just want to dance
I met her on Grafton street
Right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me
While her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean
The Gaelic ink on your arm
Said it was one of my friend s songs
Do you want to drink on
She took Jamie as a chaser Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with
Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox got up to dance
You know she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said Baby I just want to dance
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You re my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts
And then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me
Like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called
Was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice
Playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room
Swear she was singing to me
You know she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said Baby I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway Girl
My my my my my my my Galway Girl
My my my my my my my Galway Girl
My my my my my my my Galway Girl
And now we ve outstayed our welcome
And it s closing time
I was holding her hand her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs
With the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I m gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said Baby I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway Girl
My my my my my my my Galway Girl
My my my my my my my Galway Girl
My my my my my my my Galway Girl
Nah nah nah nah nah
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he s on a new diet
And watches what he eats
He s got his eyebrows plucked
And his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don t know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy so that s fine by me
But still I m just keepin it real
Still lookin at your Instagram
And I ll be creepin a lil
I ll be tryin not to double tap from way back
Cause I know that s where the trouble s at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane I wasn t Superman
Just a young boy tryin to be loved
So let me give it to ya
I don t wanna know about your new man
Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn t be callin me up tryin to
Cause I m positive that he don t wanna know about me
I don t wanna know about your new man
We ll get there eventually
I know you re missin all this kind of love
But I m positive that he don t wanna know about me
Your new man rents a house in the burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder
But I call it a purse
Every year he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer but has a six pack
I m kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors
In winter at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gang sign
Says Tune boydem light up the room
But enough about him girl let s talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin
Eatin a packet of crisps
But you will never find you cheatin
Now you re eatin kale hittin the gym
Keepin up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club
Kissin a boy that ain t him
Okay you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it
You can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you cause you oughta know
You re still a young girl tryin to be loved
So let me give it to ya
I don t wanna know about your new man
Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn t be callin me up tryin to
Cause I m positive that he don t wanna know about me
I don t wanna know about your new man
We ll get there eventually
I know you re missin all this kind of love
But I m positive that he don t wanna know about me
Baby I m not tryin to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you re with him I know you re lonely
Please remember you re still free
To make the choice and leave
Don t call me up you need to show me
I don t wanna know about your new man
Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn t be callin me up tryin to
Cause I m positive that he don t wanna know about me
I don t wanna know about your new man
We ll get there eventually
I know you re missin all this kind of love
But I m positive that he don t wanna know about me
But I m positive that he don t wanna know about
But I m positive that he don t wanna know about
I don t wanna know about your new man
She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me
When the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
None like most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby lately I know
That every night I ll kiss you you ll say in my ear
Oh we re in love aren t we
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you re holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don t break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
She is the river flowin Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame oh
Roses roses laid upon your bed spread oh my
All this all this I know
But every night I ll kiss you you ll say in my ear
Oh we re in love aren t we
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you re holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don t break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Well I ve found love inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I m not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
Cause from now until I go
Every night I kiss you you ll say in my ear
Oh we re in love aren t we
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you re holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don t break around here
Oh yeah yeah
Every night I kiss you you ll say in my ear
Oh we re in love aren t we
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you re holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don t break around here
Yeah yeah yeah
You know hearts don t break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that s been loved
Took the get well soon cards
And stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me
Don t you cry when you re down
But mum there s a tear every time that I blink
Oh I m in pieces
It s tearing me up but I know
A heart that s broke is a heart that s been loved
So I ll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you d be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he ll say Hallelujah
You re home
Fluffed the pillows made the beds
Stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he d drive
Then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life that s been lived
So I ll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you d be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he ll say Hallelujah
You re home
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back he said Hallelujah
You re home
We re not no we re not friends nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in a lie
And if they find out will it all go wrong
And heaven knows no one wants it to
So I could take the back road
But your eyes ll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me you should know
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don t treat me like you do
Well I know that there s a limit to everything
But my friends won t love me like you
No my friends won t love me like you
We re not friends we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
They ll never know what we ve been through
So I could take the back road
But your eyes ll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me you should know
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don t treat me like you do
Well I know that there s a limit to everything
But my friends won t love me like you
No my friends won t love me like you
But then again if we re not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again if we re not friends
There d be nothing I could do
And that s why friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldn t kiss me like you do
And I know that there s a limit to everything
But my friends won t love me like you
No my friends won t love me like you do
Oh my friends will never love me like you
Ain t got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage a guitar and a song
My daddy told me Son don t you get involved in
Politics religions or other people s quarrels
I ll paint the picture let me set the scene
I know when I have children
They will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family s given to me
Just love and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass some guitar
Grab a beat and away we go
I m just a boy with a one man show
No university no degree but lord knows
Everybody s talking bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
While I ll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know
Love can change the world in a moment
The revolution s coming it s a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade
I ll paint the picture let me set the scene
I know I m all for people following their dreams
Just re remember life
Is more than fittin in your jeans
It s love and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass some guitar
Grab a beat and away we go
I m just a boy with a one man show
No university no degree but lord knows
Everybody s talking bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
While I ll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know
Love can change the world in a moment
I ll paint the picture let me set the scene
You know the future s in the hands of you and me
So let s all get together we can all be free
Spread love and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass some guitar
Grab a beat and away we go
I m just a boy with a one man show
No university no degree but lord knows
Everybody s talking bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
While I ll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know
Love can change the world in a moment
Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
Cause you re waiting for me
And I know you re gonna be away a while
But I ve got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams
And just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While I m stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I ll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have come to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you ll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my heart and soul
I will only have these eyes for you
And you know everything changes
But we ll be strangers
If we see this through
You can stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While I m stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I ll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have come to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you ll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
I m stumbling off drunk
Getting myself lost
I am so gone
So tell me the way home
I m listening sad songs
Singing about love
Where it goes wrong
All my senses come to life
While I m stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I ll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have come to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you ll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
You are the one girl
You know that it s true
I m feeling younger
Every time that I m alone with you
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn t had asked but
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It s just something that I want to do
I ll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend s roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon but
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It s just something that I want to do
I ll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn t had asked
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It s just something that I want to do
I ll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
I was twenty four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father but her daddy said No
You can t marry my daughter
She and I went on the run
Don t care about religion
I m gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
Well met her at Guy s in the Second World War
And she was working on a soldier s ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters
She and I went on the run
Don t care about religion
I m gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I ve been loving her
Now we re sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There s no difference I assure ya
She and I went on the run
Don t care about religion
I m gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it s the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time s forever frozen still
So you can keep me inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won t ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it s the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
And it s the only thing we take with us when we die
We keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time s forever frozen still
So you can keep me inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won t ever be alone
And if you hurt me that s okay baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got
When you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that s okay baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won t ever let you go
When I m away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home
Be my husband I ll be your wife
Be my husband I ll be your wife
Be my husband I ll be your wife
Love and honor you for all your life

I didn t mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
Won t you just hold me tonight
I wish I never called you up
But nobody told me
They don t know we don t speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Won t you just hold me tonight
And I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret it never works out anyway
But I m not anything like it was
Cause you were the only one for me
Cause maybe I don t wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night if that s alright
I shouldn t have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don t wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth
Lies everything you are
I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
And you did the same
Again and again and again
I know
So here s to the both of us
Here s to our story tonight
And I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret it never works out anyway
But I m not anything like it was
Cause you were the only one for me
Cause maybe I don t wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night if that s alright
I shouldn t have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don t wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth
Lies everything you are
When I see my future it is with you
We ll get there
I want my children to be with you
We ll get there
Cause maybe I don t wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night if that s alright
I shouldn t have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don t wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth
Lies everything you are
Hit the corner burnin rubber
Like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana bitch I m a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check microphone check
Killed your boy s career still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin
On a back block you may catch the boss
M cig let it vape so we liftin off
With a weapon go to steppin like I m Kevin Spacey
No prom date women they would love to hate me
It s such a pretty thing life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire bitch off a nickel rock
Microphone check microphone check
We came to party smoke until there s nothing left
I met this girl late last year
She said don t you worry if I disappear
I told her I m not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We ll be in between the sheets till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then should have just said
She s singing
Don t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don t wanna know that babe
Don t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don t wanna know that babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she s staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don t want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what it s about
But maybe we ll go together and just figure it out
I d rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we ll be missing it now
Wish I d have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
Now she should figure it out while I m sat here singing
Don t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don t wanna know that babe
Don t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don t wanna know that babe
Knock knock knock on my hotel door
I don t even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn t need to take him to bed that s all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It s not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn t looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It s a bit too much too late if I m honest
And all this time God knows I m singing
Don t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don t wanna know that babe
Don t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don t wanna know that babe
Don t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don t wanna know that babe
Don t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don t wanna know that babe
I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar
Just like ringing the bells
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer
Could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And Re Stacks is what the speakers played
I ll be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat
Is where we used to stay
Just watching the Dvd smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites we needed to breathe
We used each other s air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I ll say you are beautiful without your make up
And you don t even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time s the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I m away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane
Or make a mistake so say it again
Oh Nina you should go Nina
Cause I ain t never coming home Nina
Oh won t you leave me now
And I ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that s you and me both Nina
Oh won t you leave me now
And every weekend in the winter
You d be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight
To keep your face in the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we d eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away
We d only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet creating new habits
And as if we were two rabbits and then you vanish
Back to burrow all of the celtics are disappearing
You call me selfish
I understand but I can t help it
I put my job before everything
Except my family and friends
But you ll be in between forever
So I guess we ll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings
Will only lead to complications
And I m not saying we should be taking a break
Just re evaluating quick
Before we make a mistake and it s too late
So we can either deal with the pain
Or wait to get on a plane
But in the day we ll have to say it again
Oh Nina you should go Nina
Cause I ain t never coming home Nina
Oh won t you leave me now
And I ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that s you and me both
Oh won t you leave me now
Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song go oh won t you leave me now
People grow and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back oh won t you leave me now
Oh Nina you should go Nina
Cause I ain t never coming home Nina
Oh won t you leave me now
And I ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that s you and me both
Oh won t you leave me now

I don t wanna know that babe
It s late in the evening
Glass on the side now
I ve been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don t wanna know
If you re getting ahead of the program
I want you to be my lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man s land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you re falling
Won t you let me know
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Sing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Louder
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Sing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say
And nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing We Found Love in a local rave no
I don t really know what I m supposed to say
But I can just figure it out then hope and pray
I told her my name and said it s nice to meet you
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know that she s a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness I m in deep
If anybody find out
I meant to drive home
But I drank all of it now
Not sober enough we just sat on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she s kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you re falling
Won t you let me know
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Sing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Louder
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Sing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Can you feel it
All the guys in here don t really wanna dance
Can you feel it
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it
Found you hiding here so won t you take my hand darling
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it
Can you feel it Oh no
Sing
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you re falling
Won t you let me know
Oh oh oh oh oh oh sing
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Sing
When your legs don t work like they used to before
And I can t sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
Darlin I will be lovin you
Till we re seventy
Baby my heart could still fall as hard
At twenty three
I m thinkin bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Me I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your lovin arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I m thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair s all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don t remember my name
When my hands don t play the strings the same way mm
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul
Could never grow old
It s evergreen
Baby your smile s forever in my mind and memory
I m thinkin bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it s all part of a plan
I ll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you ll understand
That baby now ooh
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I m thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
Baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars oh darlin
Place your head on my beating heart
I m thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
Maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I ll ever need
I m so in love so in love so in love so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
they just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word
and they ll all disappear into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I ll ever need
I m so in love so in love so in love so in love
Lumiere darlin
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darlin
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darlin
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darlin
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darlin
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darlin
Lumiere over me
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I ll ever need
I m so in love so in love so in love so in love
You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you better
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you are lying in the bed again
Either way I ll cry with the rest of them
My father told me son
It s not his fault he doesn t know your face
You re not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
Darlin hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we ll lie inside for a little while here oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we re wrapped In light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they re designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we set alight we re afire love
Things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
Now we re left here in the pain
Black suit black tie standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
6 years old I remember when
My father told me son
It s not his fault he doesn t know your face
You re not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
Darlin hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we ll lie inside for a little while here oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we re wrapped In light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they re designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we set alight we re afire love
My father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to say hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
My father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing
Hallelujah
I ve been spinning out of time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind sipping on red wine
I ve been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How d I get so faded how d I get so faded
No no don t leave me lonely now
If you loved me how d you never learn
Color crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
I ve been looking for a love
Thought I d find her in a bottle
God make me another one
I ll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I ve done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover
No no don t leave me lonely now
If you loved me
How d you never learn
Color crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
So tell me when it kicks in
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
So Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
I ve known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don t wanna know where he s been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes six in the morn in go
How long you leaving
Well dad just don t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It s been a long day thumb on side of the roadway but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don t wanna live in his home
There s nothing to say cos he knows
I ll just runaway and be on my own
I ve never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I ll tell you it s about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I m gonna do
Gonna runaway gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it s morn in go
How long you leaving
Well dad just don t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It s been a long day thumb on side of the roadway but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don t wanna live in his home
There s nothing to say cause he knows
I ll just runaway and be on my own
Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn t down with that plan to attack intends to show love
I don t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold up
Mama was the same
None of us are saints I guess that god knows that
I don t wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces and hope that
Things change but for now I ll leave town with a backpack on my shoulder
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don t wanna live in his home
There s nothing to say cos he knows
I ll just runaway and be on my own
No I don t wanna hate you
Just wish you d never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He s waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He s not the right guy for you
Don t hate me cos I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But fuck it I won t be changing the subject I love it
I ll make your little secret public its nothing
I m just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with
in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I m lacking sleep
Fact is you re mad at me because I backtrack
So casually
You re practically my family
If we married then I ll guess you d have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not
I don t love you baby
I don t need you baby
I don t want you no
Anymore
I don t love you baby
I don t need you baby
I don t wanna love you no
Anymore
Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I m away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I m not cut out for life on the road
Cos I didn t know I d miss you this much
And at the time we d just go so sue me
I guess I m not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I ve been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That s when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it s hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I m left with is to pick up my personal pieces Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I ll ever have and need
I guess I m unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with
I don t love you baby
I don t need you baby
I don t want you no
Anymore
I don t love you baby
I don t need you baby
I don t wanna love you no
Anymore
And since you left
I ve given up my days off
It s what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job
But mine is 24 7
I fell like writing a book
I guess I lied in the hook
Cos I still love you and I need you by my side
If I could
The irony is if my career and music didn t exist
In 6 years yeah you d probably be my wife with a kid
I m frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and its
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts
That I m trying to kill
And I d be writing my will before I m 27
I ll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge
Or did I make a mistake erasing
It s only therapy
My thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I ll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I m not prepared
But I ll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can t change
Take my apology
I m sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
I don t love you baby
I don t need you baby
I don t want you no
Anymore
I don t love you baby
I don t need you baby
I don t wanna love you no
Anymore
Ooh I m a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I can t work it out how
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though I ve known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes
All of my words are all over written on the signs
But you re my road walking me home
Home home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I m a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can t shake this feeling now
We re going through the motions
Hoping you d stop
And oh I ve only caused you pain you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you re on my road walking me home
Home home home home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I m a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
And for how long I loved my lover
For how long I loved my lover
And now for how long long I loved my lover
Now now for how long long I loved my lover
Now now for how long long I loved my lover
And I feel loved
For how long long I loved my lover
For how long long I loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long long I loved my lover
Now now for how long long I loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long I loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long long I loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long long I loved my lover
Now now for how long long I loved my lover
I m not a rapper I m a singer with a flow
I ve got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never want to get bitten
Because plagiarism is sin
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label but didn t listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn t
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I m driven
And now it s on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you
Over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now and get respect after
And I m avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it s safe to say that it kept me
Grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old I moved out of my home
I was Macey Gray I tried to say goodbye and
I choked
And we ve been sleeping at the subway station
Sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination I don t want to relax
But would it hurt your reputation
If I put it on wax
So take it back now
C mon and take it back love
C mon and take it back for us
Don t you fade into the back love
Ooh
Take it back with the rhythm and blues
And my back pack I ll be singing the news
Trying to act like Jack Black when
I m running the school
I ll make a beat with my feet
By just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
And keeping the truth through the vocal booth
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit
They try and take aim like Beckham
When he goes to shoot
But then again that s what they re supposed to do
And I m supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens is from now on
I ll be willing to start again at the end of the song
Still they claim that I handled it wrong
But then I never had an enemy except for Nme
But I ll be selling twice as many copies as
The magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
And healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses
Rubber dinghy rapids
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic
I m battling with respect
I don t know if I ll have it
This songs from the heart
Grabbing the plaque
I ll take it back now
C mon and take it back love
C mon and take it back for us
Don t you fade into the back love
Ooh
Take it back now
I don t ever want to be perfect
Cause I m a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
I accept the fact that
Someone has to win worst dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again
Living life on the edge
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that s how it s supposed to be
Screaming out vocally
Might seem totally impossible
Achieving life s dreams
But but I just write schemes
I m never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You ll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with Mcdaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we ll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That s how we put it out
It s time to take it back now
C mon and take it back love
C mon and take it back for us
Don t you fade into the back love
Ooh
C mon and take it back love
C mon and take it back for us
Don t you fade into the back love
Ooh
It s just another night
And I m staring at the moon
Saw a shooting star and thought of you
Sang a lullaby by the water side and knew
If you were here I d sing to you
You re on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
I m miles away froom seeing you
I can see the stars from America
I wonder do you see them too
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these skies will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of the stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They re playing Chasing Cars and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lands and streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam
You re the song my heart is beating to
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of the stars will guide us home
I can see the stars from America
It s alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don t wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you re alive
It s alright to die
Cause that s the only thing you haven t tried
But just for tonight
Hold on
So live life like you re giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
It s alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we ll rage
Against the dying of the light
It is alright to say
That death s the only thing you haven t
tried
But just for today
Hold on
So live life like you re giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
And hold on
Live life like you re giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
And hold on
Faces Change
But this place ll stay the same
And I ll know
When I ll go
Yeah
And I m pickin up another bag
And I pack another knapsack
The airport s like a stop light to me
Sittin on red green light go
Can t see my family
My family grew into a global trance
Or fans some may call em
And it s on the stage I stand
To jam rock sing no wakin up to stop the dream
I lived the life signed a picture
Cuz no dam could stop the stream
Or flood gates I m in a fucked race
And a pocket fulla culture condoms
They put you on the podium for first place
But on the block they judge you on em
So
Who got the South in a six pack
And a shotgun just for show
I ll put the white boys back in gold teeth
Put the hood in mossy oak
I m the
Child of a deadbeat so I gotta give the beat some life
Beat me down with criticism but at least the critic s right
With a broken pen there they go again
I m a token man I m a rollin jam
Like a rollin stone I m closin in
I m goin home I m home again
Bring it back up in the Uk
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack
Catfish Billy hell you say
I m just bein blunt homie
Keep the grass
You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don t lie
And so now my broken wings will fly
Yeah take one look
Better yet take two
But if I take that break there s a move you made
This dude you shape will come take you back
Back to the roots I ve been
Without a fuckin pot to pee in
Or a spot to sleep in
Hot or cold outside it s not the season
Cuz I am not the reason
That the image you re used to seein
Is usually being fake so to me the hate is meaningless
Meaning yes I m different
Differently made
And me screamin the A
Is not the difference in grades
It s the place I stayed
Cuz the schools were underpaid
The teachers taught but to me they fought
A star that was underway
It was under Wayne it was in my name
Michael
M W A
Atha
And in trouble I stayed
Breakin out of this bubble they made
Played with the dice but I rolled that seven
And I ll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand
Committed to the words I say
A blood line s not a family tree
It s a needle in my skin for all to see
I ain t never got a spring break tattoo drunk
But I drink and take the ink
You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don t lie
And so now my broken wings will fly
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin s sons
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb higher into the night
Calling out father oh stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
Oh should my people fall then
Surely I ll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the sky s falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out
Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
I see fire oh you know I saw a city burning
Fire
And I see fire feel the heat upon my skin fire
And I see fire fire
And I see fire burn on and on the mountainside
Yelawolf
For fuck s sake
Ed Sheeran
Living the life of a student
Yeah I begin on a high
Losing my mind
And they say that I ve been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five
Eh
Yelawolf
It s kinda like I took a train
To the left side of my brain oh main
Toddle some mud under my door
You know I m stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology psychologically insane
Part of me wanna get down down down
Making you go low inside
Ed Sheeran
You don t know if you don t know by now
You better tell him bout it
What you gonna tell him bout it
Yeah yeaaaah
Yelawolf
Ten toes to the dirt
Pencil to the paper
God has a favour for your thirst
Drink drink ya pint bye bye
To this bullshit praise allah
To the wheels I m a ridah
Steering your prada
Only closed in my ada di das
I m a fetus in my boom sake nana
Daddy s home on the mic hey papa
Ed Sheeran
Back with my bang yo straight loop on my
But every single one of my fans know that
Every damn show I m taking their ears on a journey
Like I m flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics cause they think I ve been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes rocking a Kangol
I m riding round with Yelawolf in your daddy s Lambo
Yelawolf
Hello me how ya been
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You re probably sipping sweet tee s you still huh
And your piggy bank is full of change
Fact what you used to steal from
You been playing fools like a steel drum
Pulling out early and they still come
Eating from the game when you know the meal s done
Yelawolf is kicking back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby sit still son
Woah this old rock it heals been rolled
Still shocking when I see em go
Bananas and they hammer the
Hook
You don t know if you don t know by now
You better tell him bout it
What you gonna tell him bout it
Yeah yeaaaah
Yelawolf
I m not the average half wit
After this hour gets out of this
60 seconds I m going in any directions
And chasing this jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
It s probably the better idea you move the direction in
Fact its a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blowing his fucking mics like the winds
Hooligans hooligans hooligans
But really who s a friend
Jump in this little fire jump right back in the pool again
Know I be new again
A student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers I m tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4 minus war
You don t want it
Shady records I m already better fuck it doggonnit
Dog don t gotta lead
Dog s already home
Jack dog I m a beast I m a wolf
Bring your dogs back
A melody man in a melancholic mellow yellow can
Shhh tell him how we gonna sell em man
Been working hard all week
So if you wonder if we earned it well its not a probably
So won t you bring that back to me
And holla when you hear it like all the screams of a halloween
I got blisters on my feet
To walk in night with you is not the shoes to be borrowing
So won t you bring that back to me
Cause all the sole of my pin is what all the sorrow brings
If you don t know if you don t know no no no
If you don t know if you don t know no no no
If you don t know if you don t know no no no
If you don t know if you don t know no no no
Yelawolf
There wasn t much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last cheque
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette
Feeling half dead whisky on my mind
Then came the dead
Sherrif in the yard here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost they all passed by
My girl cried baby this ll be my last bye
Baby in her arms
She took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave
Nonchalant about it
Maybe she ll come back
This time I doubt it
Act like I care but I really don t
Wanted to change
But somehow I knew I really won t
See I m the type of man who can t stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I d rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can t heal
Maybe I ll love blood I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand
God s not going to land another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock and be late again
One gun and a harley in the driveway
One way out dirt road pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention
In fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away
And he started singing
Ed Sheeran
London Bridge is falling down falling down
And if it don t stop falling then all of us will drown
Then we ll crash crash right down again
Oh we ll crash crash right down again
Yelawolf
I didn t see it coming
I didn t see the wall
And I went from running to a slow crawl
I feel like I m a child but I m afraid to cry
Would say I m okay but I m afraid to lie
I speak no evil but hear no angels
A family is callin but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over ice cold hell s door
Knock knock
I m on the salt road non stop
The exit I will pass cause the sign did rot
And the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap
I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge
But I can t forget the sound
Ed Sheeran
London Bridge is falling down falling down
And if it don t stop falling then all of us will drown
Then we ll crash crash right down again
Oh we ll crash crash right down again
I ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can t be found
Only my God can track me down
x4
And we ll crash crash right down again
Oh we ll crash crash right down again
I ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can t be found
Only my God can track me down
x2
I ll be coming up when the sun goes down
I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You ll be sinking in
So we ll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I ll hold ya and you think of him
And pretty soon you ll be floating away
And I ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat love
And I m captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
When the salted tears won t dry
I ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes your eyes you eyes
I still taste salt water
Oh my lips from your kiss bitterness
And I drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you
These cuffs are covered in your make up
I ll never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And I ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat love
And I m captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
When the salted tears won t dry
I ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes your lips your mouth
Your thighs your back you drive me wild
Tonight the fact design
I m on my way home
On the way home
I lied I tried to cry
But I m drowning in the oceans you made
When the salted tears won t dry
I ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes your eyes you eyes
You and I
Two of a mind
This love is one of a kind
You and I
We re drifting over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And If I fall for you
Would you fall too
You and I
Learning to speak with kisses on cheeks
You and I
We re lifting over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if fall for you
Would you fall too
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if fall for you
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
The rain won t stop falling
It s harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor
What I need to know
Is if you love me and I really need to know
Is if you want me when you call
If you want me when you call
We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework dodging classes
To set off fire alarms
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you call
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving
And what I need to know
We are waving
Is if you love me and I
We are waving
Really need to know
We are waving
If you need me when you call
We are waving
What I need to know
We are waving
Is if you love me and I
We are waving
Really need to know
We are waving
If you need me when you call
What I need to know
Is if you love me and I really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you call
I paid all my dues and she wanted to know
That I d never leave her now I m ready to go
As strange as it seems she s endless to me
She s just like paperwork but harder to read
Patience s my enemy loving s my friend
It s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh she knows me so well
Oh she knows me like I know myself
I made all my plans and as she has made hers
She kept me in mind but I wasn t sure
I searched every room for a way to escape
But every time I try to leave she keeps holding on to me for delight
And blocking my way
Patience s my enemy loving s my friend
It s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh she knows me so well
Oh she knows me like I know myself
And like the back of her hand she already understands everything
Won t you stay she says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands I ll stay anyway
Cause she knows me so well
Oh she knows me like I know myself
Oh she knows me so well
Oh she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh she knows me like I know myself
I know myself I know myself
I know myself
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they won t be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody I suppose it s true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I ll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I ll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close
5 o clock with lights off interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said that I ll sleep when I m dead
Who s on the beat upon the feature with Ed
It s D E V to the Zed
Over tired pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I ve acquired
And over the time within this maze I think you ll find you ll
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you re dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for
To sleep or even take four seconds out the game it s time to wage war
Scissors grab a sword and sharpen up your hunting knives
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I m hailing from the Essex and the East London border line
Villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like you re snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I m living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I m living in lately
Verse 3 Ed Sheeran
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow I live with the rats now and those
That hate me call me Ron but they won t slither in too easy
Believe me I m snake minded be within this great time be
On minimum wage life is a prison escape that I m in
It s all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si li cone
I m still broke without the money for a Mac Pro
Living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
I wake dead take deep breaths try to never die never die
Verse 4 Devlin
Two guys with the same view keep it tight like Scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you we ll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while you re catching Zed s the masses like to move
We scan the situation analyse information
And then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen I ve hardly changed my bed sheets
At all over the last 12 months cause I haven t slept in em true
I m coming home the lights are on your rights are wrong so I m correcting em
We got the fans all like Oh wow it s Devs and Ed
What less did you bloody expect from em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o clock to 5 o clock
And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I m only trying to stay awake
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I m living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I m living in lately
Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I ’ m next to you
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you
Do I hate you
I can ’ t make up my mind
So let ’ s freefall
See where we land
It ’ s been this way since we were young
We ’ ll fight and then make up
I ’ ll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you
Do I hate you
I can ’ t make up my mind
So let ’ s freefall
And see where we land
She s like cold coffee in the morning
I m drunk off last night s whiskey and coke
She ll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I m in on the joke
And you can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if I m wrong tell me if I m right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
I ll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don t have to be so please go back to sleep
Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if I m wrong tell me if I m right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
Cause I love the way you wake me up
For goodness sake will my love not be enough
Tell me if I m wrong tell me if I m right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
Tell me if I m wrong tell me if I m right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Hmm let me go
To see my family
Please Father let me go
As my mother sleeps
I don t know about days gone
But round here nobody lives twice
When your gone your gone without no bye
Because only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me I nearly lost my life
3 weeks after I got this rhyme
It seems like I had too much wine
Which that I I didn t get one
Anyway I was going to the booked for a set
Even though I didn t have a set one
Skream hit the decks I was like check one
Put on a show but it weren t my best one
Left it dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
20 minutes later I was on the M1
Tired
But I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No motion in my face
No movement in my legs but the car still kept going
Woke up
Lorry
Flash
Panic
Break
Skid
Crash
Skidded
More
Bang
Smash
Out
Cold
Ribs
Cracked
Ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a Megan that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled didn t even know my name
Fainted too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again
I just want you to take a second hear me out
Don t think I m happy cuz I smile when you see me out
I ve had serious madnesses where I ve nearly disappeared
Oh I m begging Lord to save me and let me go
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please Father let me go
Keep me safe as my mother sleeps
Eyes closed they just wouldn t open
I can hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life can t tell if I m winning
One of the worst situations I ve been in
I can hear all of the angels singing
But when it stopped humming
My brain turned on stared running
Still in pain but it started numbing
the stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows cuz I didn t wanna tell them that I weren t coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that I m in inside
Ever so cunning
6 weeks later jogging and running
I used the first air kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me when it comes to mistakes
You can t afford to let one in
Never done dream for a while
The black plan was blocked
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But he forgot to tell you you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu Tang
But when your time s up that s it it s you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes I ll be on my way to a show
Thinking I just wanna see my brother
Then do a U turn I m gone Runner
I just want you to take a second hear me out
Don t think I m happy cuz I smile when you see me out
I ve had serious madnesses where I ve nearly disappeared
Oh I m begging Lord to save me and let me go
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes while my brother weeps
Save my soul
verse 1 mikill pane
Listen
Little lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday
It s 30 degrees thursday
You work late you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes
Lady the word rape sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you no your legs will ache if you try
you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for
You ll make a trip to the whittington were they ll look at your jaw
They ll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They ll know your fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman
The pimp see s you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal
cause the cunt wouldn t ever let a doctor near someone thats getting dough for him
cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in
chorus ed sheeran
She s just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
she don t wanna go outside tonight
cos in the pipe she ll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It s too cold outside for angels to fly
verse 2 mikill pane
Little lady your mind you ve made up
Your injurys you can t hide with make up
You need some medical advice you make up
A little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don t decide to play dumb
With any luck you ll see the same dude who stiched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn t recognise if you stared him in the face anyway
cos all the heroin is making you age
But your a heroin for taking the strain of being a prostitue and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using moneygram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know your never coming back
She put you in her brother s hand only for him to formulate another plan
He s the fucking cause of your appalling state the summer fans
See that you came to london to get pimped by your uncle damn
chorus ed sheeran
She s just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
she don t wanna go outside tonight
cos in the pipe she ll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It s too cold outside for angels to fly
Now an angel will die covered in white
With closed eyes hoping for a better life
This time we ll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
verse 3 mikill pane
Little lady your trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles the dear
Your sitting facing the detective oh dear
The meddling nurse couldn t just leave it
She s only gone and made it much worse calling police and
She ll never know the gravity of the damage she s caused
Your causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The coppers trying to calm you telling you he won t let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you who you working for
He s talking to like your worth more than a dirty whore
Your having a conversation you could be murdered for
Your learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
It s kicking knowledge you ain t ever heard before
Just before he leaves he reassures you that he knows that it s hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it
He s useless if your gonna be stupid
cos an answer hasn t come from your bruised lips your on your own
You ve gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you ve been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says where you been bitch I wanna know
No prizes for guessing who it is resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door he boots you in
There s something new in him he s silent now that fills you with terror
Get your albibi straight you could be killed for an error
He towers over you the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbags dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there s only one thing that s caught his eye
And in the moment of rage he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his merc in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her 30th birthday
chorus ed sheeran
we re all under the upper hand
go mad for a couple grams
we don t wanna go outside tonight
cos in the pipe she ll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It s too cold outside for angels to fly
The thoughts I have could be clear ones they can seem vivid
The goals I reach are not near ones the further the limit
I block her out so when I m looking though my mind she ain t in it
Can I be free for a minute Can I be me for a minute
The thoughts I have can be dark ones even be smart ones
I know I m gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum
It s you that I live for I m the first and the last one to love you lots
What s better than thinking about the ones you love
Nothing much when you re thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I m on the floor see the sun above
Unconditional like bills payed when I ve run em up
No one here to help you pay now you re gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you re all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is I wasn t so I m coming from a quarter zone
And when the sun falls down I ll be up again and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I ll see nothing when nothing when
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you now for you
I wanna see you happy I wanna see you smile
Cause you ve been trespassing and you won t leave my mind
Now I ve been thinking about this you told me say Yes Nan
I m 31 now I m still saying Yes Nan
You had to replace my mum dad two parents in one
I know you re proud staring at your grandson I found a job I like
Got the flat the cars to buy got the quad I like
And cause of you and Kylie it s in every single song I write
Had a golden life wanted people to honour mine
Tell em while I m here cause one day I m gonna die
And when I m gone I want my music to play
And when my people listen to this track it s gonna make em wanna cry
I ain t gonna lie I think about the scene I made
I say the game s better it s a must now I ve gotta fly
My talents gonna shine real shortly fam i know it
I work round the clock I don t stop at night
And when the sun falls down I ll be up again and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I ll see nothing when nothing when
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you now for you
Hi my name is JME there was a time when radio played me
Cause my music came from my heart it was real to me
But now it s a part
I m here struggling keeping it real while the rest of them are hustling seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think JME just do one tune make a couple cheese and chill
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that I ll never do it I swear
I didn t go through all of that for this
I ll give that a miss that s just how it is I m fair straight
Who can tell me different you could be determined
Man on a mission my music is me and I am my music
So like it or lump it I ma do this
Chorus
I never had a playlist in my heart ooh
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I ve been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark ooh
Are you gonna play me though this song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin I m just doing my thing and I don t have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though If this song s not a hit on the radio oho oho oho oh
Thank God for night clubs and the raves
Cos I don t think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down but cordial music is boring me now
I swear I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene what your role is
I m still trying here cause I m a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I m just telling you the truth
Cant shoot the messenger bullet proof booth
You won t hear me on the radio but go to the rave and the crowd they re raising roof
Why does that What s going on there
To tell you the truth I don t really care
I am my music my music is me
Like it or lump it this is how it s gonna be
Chorus
I never had a playlist in my heart ooh
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I ve been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark ooh
Are you gonna play me though this song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin I m just doing my thing and I don t have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though If this song s not a hit on the radio oho oho oho oh
I feel it on the airwave spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers written by the pile
So won t you hear me out
Never feel it from the base line feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won t you hear me out
I never had a playlist in my heart ooh
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I ve been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark ooh
Are you gonna play me though this song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin I m just doing my thing and I don t have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though If this song s not a hit on the radio oho oho oho oh
White lips pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs sour taste
Light s gone day s end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights strange men
And they say
She s in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause we re just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don t want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It s too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house wet clothes
Loose change bank notes
Weary eyed dry throat
Call girl no phone
And they say
She s in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause we re just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
But she don t want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It s too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time we ll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She s in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we re all under the upperhand
Go mad for a couple of grams
And we don t want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It s too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly fly
Angels to fly to fly to fly
Angels to die
I m in so deep
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real
Pain ain t the emotion I want to feel but I m thriving off it
So it s only right I like this topic I be on a hill
Keeping my head above water
I can t afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It s dark when I m about just me myself and my shadow
And I m parro running out of ammo
And it seems like everyone around me s on the same path so it s narrow
The less then the better
More proof for the last one left
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise how they ever gonna guess I m clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I ve got a lot to lose
So when I watch the news my minds infected with terror
No wonder I m under stress
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds
And when they left it looked like I d had a rave
And invited more than a hundred guests
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence
It seems when you look back shoulda woulda coulda
But I bet you can t bring should woulda could back
Back to 15
I said to myself that I m more than a hoodrat
OO you can drag me in the deep ends
OO but you will never drown me out
OO you can drag me in the deep ends
OO but you will never drown me out out out
You won t drown me out out out
You won t drown me out
You can never drown me out the water supply s too low
And I m round about 6 1 10 stone
I ve never seen someone drown without
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
And I m an MC my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I m choking
Seriously do I sound like I m joking I m floating
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that sunk many years blud I m maintaining
Plain sailing no commotion
Like a dolphin when it s in motion
Nothing can t break me so why would I show them I m broken
No real stress no my skin ain t close to corrosion
Fuck them all this ain t tug of war still they ll get roped in the open
I don t want to reveal my violent side but I swear that I will soon
If the Lord above don t provide a sign then I mma kill you
Arm for arm eye for eye
I just want to live my life
But they don t want to see this guy survive
OO you can drag me in the deep ends
OO but you will never drown me out
OO you can drag me in the deep ends
OO but you will never drown me out out out
You won t drown me out out out
You won t drown me out
Now I m in town break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night
In front of a new crowd
That s you now ciao
Seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can t no I wont hush
I say the words that make you blush
I m gonna sing this now
See I m true my songs are where my heart is
I m like glue I stick to other artists
I m not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing
I move to greener pastures
See I m real I do it all it s all me
I m not fake don t ever call me lazy
I won t stay put give me the chance be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cos you need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
At all you need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
At all you need me
I sing I write my own tune and I write my
Own verse hell
Don t need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer writer you re just bluffing
Name s on the credits and you didn t write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shit s cool
I will blast and I didn t go to brits school
I came fast with the way I act right
I can t last if I smoking on a crack pipe
And I won t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in wikipedia
And musically I m demonstrating
When I perform live it feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
Young singer writer like a gabriella cilmi
Cos you need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
Until you need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
Until you need me
Cause with the lyrics I ll be aiming it right
I won t stop till my name is in light
Stadium heights with damien rice
On red carpets now I m on arabian nights
Because I m young I know my brother s gonna give me advice
Long nighter short heigh and I m going hyper
Never be anything but a singer songwriter
yeah the game s over but now I m on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I m bound to blow up
I ve done around about a thousand shows
But I haven t got a house plus I live on the couch
So you could be the lyrics when I m singing them out
From day one I ve been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I m back to this sofa giving a dose
Of what the future holds
Cos it s another day plus
I keep my last name forever keep the genre
Pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people s tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper s shoes using new laces
I m selling cd s from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cd s from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I m still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
I m still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I m always doing shows if I m not I m in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Rufio
Melody music maker reading all the papers
They say I m up and coming like I m fucking in
An elevator
Cos you need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
At all you need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
You need me man I don t need you
At all you need me
Man I don t need you
They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I m working to achieve but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease
To the retrieve then I can t let them be
I won t let em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn t ready then like a lemon s green
Now I m in the magazines almost every week
Cause I m getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it s better than it s ever been
Never fade like a plant that s evergreen
It s what I hoped in my heart but my self doubts are getting me
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I m getting weak
Cause I m new I m not where the stars be
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I m on my own even though I m smooth sailing
I m scared to sing cause my nightmares ll fade in
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh oh oh
I feel my nightmares watching me
You better wake up cause I am making moves
And even when I m dozing I m breaking rules
I m only hitting the sack when I m training
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that s where I m heading
I fly straight with the best man I embed em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding then I had to fight to get her
Now I m taking control of my inception
Cause they try to hit my misses with my erection
See they better marry donna cause when I strike strike
Not even Argentina s gonna cry for them
See I m awake at night with the ammunish
The haters know where the family lives
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger
Is gonna lose a lot more than I need it
They say sleep is the cousin of death
But I hear shit cousin I am deaf
Gang signs I m a N A reading
I m a Ceo man you suckers are next
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh oh oh
I feel my nightmares watching me
They watching me They watch me sleep
Let me go
I fell asleep on sofa woke up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
I ve been rhyming forever got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve your dreams you can t doze off cause you dream a sleep
I ain t nodding off but I m nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets when I should have been asleep
See all the dreams I m fond of
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now I m Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I m Mr can t turn up
And I missed my chance worst luck
Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner
Ch yeah but I walked from that ish
Now they gotta put me to rest mattress
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh oh oh
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me
Could I wake up next to you when we re hitting double figures
Look into your eyes like I m looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer Everything s such a blur
It s not my turn it s hers to get hurt
On a late night coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face I m home at the same time
Highbury estate s fine
Smoking like a dragon but don t chase lines
I haven t slept for the past week
Two hours ain t enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am
I haven t changed since our last meet
I m still getting all my meals for free
Think I m being shunned by my feet again
It s not a homeless life for me
It s just I m home less than I d like to be
And now I m sitting on a night bus flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver turns the lights off lights on on stage mics on
Song plays nice one gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be never went to Uni
People see right through me but I m not a fool see
I m never gonna do one gonna live past 22 done
Everything I need to except get a 2 1
I haven t slept for the past week
Two hours ain t enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am
I haven t changed since our last meet
I m still getting all my meals for free
Think I m being shunned by my feet again
It s not a homeless life for me
It s just I m home less than I d like to be
When I feel cold you keep me warm
And I m not looking for some loose changes
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet
It s not a homeless life for me
It s just I m home less than I d like to be
Hey can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know hmm
I hope you can hear what I write to you
how could I say goodbye to you
when I m a life that came out of the inside of a life
that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food
for the whole fam
you came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
cold double 8 8 kids bare wheels plus racists full of
hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
rest in life in you working but you were never stressed free
just locked in a cage slaving they said they were
gold in the pavements but you came and saw the road to
amazement broke your heart but still you were prone
to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday no
one can top your chicken and rice
even through the darkness times
you held us all up cause your vision was
bright I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
you never let anyone see your heartache
you just got on with it
anyone tells me that they knew you said
you were beautiful and your words you would stand
strong with it Cause they were like warmth on a winter
night but I was just too young to go on with it and
there something s I could try to do but it s an
impossible task for me to even try and say goodbye to
you I couldn t do that I owe my life to you
And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign I
hope this pain will heal in time
you know I never want to be alone ohh
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there can I say goodbye to you
and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you ohh
I think you phoney I was younger with the knowledge of
things that I know now I would be by your side when you
needed me instead of asking you Nan can I go out
standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
everyone s missing you loads Jessica s grown up
warren Lauren and Alex are fine and imp living with
hope it s been a while since I ve seen V and the
mouths I miss seeing and being a family and us agreeing
with smiles how it used to be as a child but as time
goes by the bridge seems longer family problems have
never been funny in my heart the only one that dissed
me was Sonia she took all our inheritance money left
the rest of us to pick up the pieces i never forgive
the way she betrayed us there ent a big enough reason
before I sell out my fam ill be giving up breathing
but I guess that everyone s different or should I say
no one s perfect she had happiness in front of her but
chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing Since you
gone the foundations crumbled so building it back up is
my next step I got all the bricks and the cement but
it s hard when it s done I don t know what to expect
so give me the strength that I need to perform this
task make it right I must do and I ask cause I trust
you it goes way beyond a song when I say I love you
And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign I
hope this pain will heal in time
you know I never want to be alone ohh
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you
It s just for now so I should hush I ll never get
enough I ll see you when I see you but I miss you
ohh how I miss you It s just for now so I should hush
I ll never get enough I ll see you when I see you but I
miss you ohh how I miss you
there ain t enough words to describe how sorry I am for
the pain that I caused sorry for when I stuck up my
own blood we were young he said I was rape and he broad
and for the day police came to the door I m sorry for
being such a bad youth stealing from your purse and
making you mourn I never been able to say this
before cause I ve was so inconsiderate you love me
unconditionally and I took advantage of it like a idiot
not seeing the pure soul that I was living with I
really hope that you can forgive me you going away
was a punishment but I won t let go I m holding you
with me but I still fight the emotions within me
You see the stars as the cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there
Can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face or
feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you
The city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it s late
Sirens beat through my window cill
I can t close my eyes
Don t control what I m into
This town is alive
With lights that blind keep me awake
Put my hood up unlace and tie
The street fills my mind
Don t control what I m into
London calls me a stranger
A traveller Ohoohohh
This is now my home My home
Oh Woah
Burning on the back street
Oh Woah
Stuck here sitting in the back seat
Oh Woah
And I m blazing on the street
What I do isn t upto you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
It ll take me where I need to go
If I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I m used to
The shop across the road
It fills my needs and keeps me company
When I need it
Voices beat through my walls
I don t think I m gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me a stranger
A traveller Ohoohohh
This is now my home My home
Oh Woah
Burning on the back street
Oh Woah
Stuck here sitting in the back seat
Oh Woah
And I m blazing on the street
What I do isn t upto you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sounds of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this To keep me alive
The traffic stops and starts but I
Need to move alone
London calls me a stranger
This is now my home Home
Oh Woah
Burning on the back street
Oh Woah
Stuck here sitting in the back seat
Oh Woah
And I m blazing on the street
What I do isn t upto you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
I should ink my skin
With your name
And take my passport out again
Just replace it
See I could do without
A tan on my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
And fill it up with bubbles
Cause maybe you re loveable
And maybe you re my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to grey
In the winter I ll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I m just in love
When you wake me up
And would you ever feel guilty
If you did the same to me
Would you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love shrek
Cause we ve watched it twelve times
But maybe you re hoping for a fairytale too
And if your dvd breaks today
You should ve gotten a VCR
Cause I ve never owned a blue ray true say
And I ve always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost I d got cross
Then chuck all the controllers at the tv
And then you d laugh at me
And be asking me if I m gonna be home next week
And then you d lie with me til I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets
And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I m just in love
When you wake me up
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try get me to stop
You drink as much as me and I get drunk a lot
So I ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I ll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I ll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
You just need to breathe
To feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
So maybe I m just in love
When you wake me up
But maybe I m just in love
When you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love
When you woke me up
You re just a small bump unborn
In four months you re brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you ll have your mother s eyes
I ll hold your body in my hands
Be as gentle as I can
But for now you re a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months
you ll open your eyes
And I ll whisper quietly and give you nothing but truth
If you re not inside me I ll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you ll be alright
You re just a small bump unknown
You ll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump in four months you ll open your eyes
And I ll hold you tightly and tell you nothing but truth
If you re not inside me I ll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you ll be alright
You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you re half asleep
I ll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you ll be alright
You were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we re still unaware as why
Filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you
For all of the summer
I have my plan
That you won t remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need your smile
And your kiss
Cause you re so cool
You re so beautiful
You re so
You re so
You re so cool
You re so beautiful
You re so
You re so
I see your grace
From my window
When it is late at night
It ll show me your shadow
I have my plan
That you won t remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need your smile
And your kiss
Cause you re so cool
You re so beautiful
You re so
You re so
You re so cool
You re so beautiful
You re so
You re so
You re so cool
You re so beautiful
You re so
You re so
You re so cool
You re so beautiful
You re so
You re so
These words I say mean
You re so amazing
I ve noticed lately
I need you maybe
These words I say mean
You re so amazing
I ve noticed lately
I need you maybe
Cause you re so cool
You re so beautiful
You re so
You re so
You re so cool
You re so beautiful
You re so
You re so
Unhappy days that left us on the floor
And you d breathe me til you re not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton I ll take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened I ll make it disappear
Darling don t be nervous
I ll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose now
When I m missing you I ll stop eating food
And I ll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you
And then I ll see your bitterness
And why you re leaving too
Maybe I ll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you
Sunny days that left my skin blood red
And you squeeze me til these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
I ll give up and be frustrated
Can you see what s wrong
If you feel like you ve been hated
This loves too overrated
See what s going on on
Darling don t be nervous
I ll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose now
When I m missing you I ll stop eating food
And I ll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you
And then I ll see your bitterness
And why you re leaving too
Maybe I ll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you
Take me back to live at home take me back to Albert Road
Now I m missing you I ve stopped eating food
And I ve squeezed in to your dress so I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too
I thought I ll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you
And I ve stopped eating food
And I ve squeezed in to your dress so I could feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too
Maybe I ll put you to a test and say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too
You re not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see I m searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes
And I saw her staring back at me
So I will try and find another one
Who suits me as well as her
I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me dear
But things aren t clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I d miss you
And I miss you
She was mine
I was hers
And all that s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that would be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me dear
But things aren t clear woah
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I d miss you
And I miss you
Don t drop me in
It s not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn
Don t drop me in
It s not my turn
And if you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I d miss you
And I miss you
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse that I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn t kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup
Lip sticks to me so now I ll maybe leave back there
I m sat here wishing I was sober
I know I ll never hold you like I used to
But the house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I ll be freezing
Can t rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you leaving me
Should I Should I
Maybe I ll get drunk again
I ll be drunk again
I ll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
I ll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I ve got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then Keep it between friends
Though I know you ll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light us
Flames just create us burns don t heal like before
You don t hold me anymore
On cold days Coldplay s out like the band s name
I know I can t heal things with a handshake
You know I can t change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
I m here to applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I Should I
Maybe I ll get drunk again
I ll be drunk again
I ll be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself
I m here again
All by myself
You know I ll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I m just drunk again
I ll be drunk again
I ll be drunk again
To feel a little love
Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms
And your heart s against my chest
Your lips pressed in my neck
I m falling for your eyes
But they don t know me yet
And with a feeling I ll forget
I m in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We re falling in love
Settle down with me
And I ll be your safety
You ll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I m cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms
And your heart s against my chest
Your lips pressed in my neck
I m falling for your eyes
But they don t know me yet
And with a feeling I ll forget
I m in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We re falling in love
Yeah I ve been feeling everything
From hate to love from love to lust
From lust to truth I guess that s how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We re falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We re falling in love
I found your hair band on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you ve been here before
And I don t get waves of missing you anymore
They re more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry so I get high
Smoke away the days never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I m still drunk at the end of the night
I don t drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got
My mind s with you but my heart s just not
So am I close to you anymore if it s over
And there s no chance that we ll work it out
That s why you and I
Ended over U N I
And I said that s fine
But you re the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U N I
And I said that s fine
But you re the only one that knows I lied
Everybody said we d be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down
Come around break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts and I dance with my views
Everything s great not everything s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I m in position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect
But we were nervous on the surface
And I m always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day
We fell in love on first kiss
So am I close to you anymore if it s over
And there s no chance that we ll work it out
That s why you and I
Ended over U N I
And I said that s fine
But you re the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U N I
And I said that s fine
But you re the only one that knows I lied
Because if I was gonna go somewhere
I d be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down
And I m thinking I m unaware
I keep my feet on the ground
And keep looking around to make sure
I m not the only one to feel low
Because if you want
I ll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I ve done wrong
And I know you ll say that I m the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will
Cause you and I
Ended over U N I
And I said that s fine
But you re the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U N I
And I said that s fine
But you re the only one that knows I lied
This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one that make me loose it all
You are the start of something new ooh
And I throw it all away
Watched you fall into my arms again
And I throw it all away
Watch you fall now
You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing
And I throw it all away
Watched you fall into his arms again
And I throw it all away
Watched you fall now
And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall down to earth
Take me back for
This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new
My mind is a worrier
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the colour of red like a sunset
I ll never keep it bottled up
And left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart not a follower
We re not done yet
And I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I m never gonna let you down
I ll never let you down
And I m keeping on the down low
And I ll keep you around so I ll know
That I ll never let you down
I ll never let you down
You re strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I ve never felt this way
I ll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down now
You re strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I never felt this way
I ll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down now
My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow
For your weary head to lay to rest again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror
To take me to the edge again now
And I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I m never gonna let you down
I ll never let you down
I ll keep it on the down low
And I ll keep you around so I ll know
That I ll never let you down
I ll never let you down
You re strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I ve never felt this way
I ll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You re strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I never felt this way
I ll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And I ll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
I ll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
I ll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And I ll never let you down
You re strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I ve never felt this way
I ll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You re strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I never felt this way
I ll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
I m gonna pick up the pieces
And build a lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
And three words have
Two meanings
There s one thing on my mind
It s all for you
And it s dark in the cold December
But I ve got you to keep me warm
If you re broken then I will mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm
That s raging on now
I m out of touch
I m out of love
I ll pick you up
When you re getting down
And out of all these things I ve done
I think I love you better now
I m out of sight
I m out of mind
I ll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things I ve done
I think I love you better now
Now
I m gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right
We could frame it
And put you on a wall
And it s so hard to say it
But I ve been here before
Now I ll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I m out of touch
I m out of love
I ll pick you up
When you re getting down
And out of all these things I ve done
I think I love you better now
I m out of sight
I m out of mind
I ll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things I ve done
I think I love you better now
Don t hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it s more than I can take
And it s dark in the cold December
But I ve got you to keep me warm
If you re broke then I will mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm
That s raging on now
I m out of touch
I m out of love
I ll pick you up
When you re getting down
And out of all these things I ve done
I think I love you better now
I m out of sight
I m out of mind
I ll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things I ve done
I think I love you better now
I m out of touch
I m out of love
I ll pick you up
When you re getting down
And out of all these things I ve done
I will love you better now
You give me life like lots of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight tight enough to know
That you are mine I d never let you go
And it s you I miss and it s you I miss
So let it out let it out now
I let it out I let it out now now
You speak me to me behind your Dublin unverified step
And you let me be as if I wasn t there
It seemed perfect the concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot true I was just like you
We couldn t be torn apart you see we were just like glue
It s you I miss and it s you I miss
So let it out let it out now
I let it out I let it out now now
It seemed perfect the concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot true I was just like you
We couldn t be torn part you see we were just like glue
We re like glue
So let it out let it out now
Let it out let it out now now
It seemed perfect the concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot true I was just like you
We couldn t be torn apart you see we were just like glue
Give me love like her
Cause lately I ve been waking up alone
Pain splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I d let them go
And I ll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I ll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me
Or burn this out
We ll play hide and seek
To turn this around
All I want is the taste
That your lips allow
My my my my oh give me love
My my my my oh give me love
My my my my give me love
Give me love like never before
Cause lately I ve been craving more
And it s been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know I ll fight my corner
And that tonight I ll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me
Or burn this out
We ll play hide and seek
To turn this around
All I want is the taste
That your lips allow
My my my my oh give me love
Give a little time to me
Or burn this out
We ll play hide and seek
To turn this around

If we take this bird in with its broken leg
We could nurse it she said
Come in side for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep it wouldn t be the worst thing
But when I wake up and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down would you stay now
And let me hold ya ohh
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you strawberries taste how lips do
And it s not complete yet mustn t get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret diving in too soon
And I ll owe it all to you oh my little bird
My little bird
If we take a walk out in the morning dew
We can lay down so I m next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep then at least your next to me
And if I wake up say it s late love get back to sleep
I m covered by nature and I m safe now
Underneath this oak tree with you beside me
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you strawberries taste how lips do
And it s not complete yet mustn t get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret diving into soon
And I ll owe it all to you oh my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
And of all this thing I m sure of
I m not quite certain of your love
You made me scream but then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you strawberries taste how lips do
And it s not complete yet mustn t get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret diving into soon
But I ll owe it all to you oh my little bird
My little bird whoa oh oh oh whoaa
My little bird
My little bird
You re my little bird
Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I m a bad influence that ll do
‘ Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth change my clothes
Just don t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go don t be slow
This ll only take a mo
Take yourself right out of my door
It s just that they don t care
Dad said beware watch your back
ajust don t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl s trouble
Time spent in burnt down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
‘ Cos you re a bad influence that ll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth change your clothes
Just don t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go don t be slow
This ll only take a mo
Take yourself right out of my door
It s just that they don t care
Dad said beware watch your back
Just don t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever either
Dance as you re a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you don t see
Fell the weight gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2d
The only thing that s free in life is love
And that don t come cheap
It s just that they don t care
Dad said beware watch your back
Just don t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl s trouble
Lying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut with a vengeance
Hey did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence
Oh well she s a local girl
No make up
Cos she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one night man
Is it fast food
I ll regret it after
And I needed money
But I m too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her I love her
And she s all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
She s still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B E P on radio
It makes me feel naughty
She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one night man
I don t wanna go alone
I don t wanna go alone
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she s more
Than a one night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she s more than a one night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don t then I ll tell her myself
And we ve got love in us
So if the drink kill us
We re gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
I say I hate wasps too
I don t really dance
So I ll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight
Tell me if that s alright
I don t wanna be here
I m not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You don t mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What you re wearing
I don t wanna go alone
I don t wanna go alone
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she s more
Than a one night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she s more
Than a one night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don t I ll tell her myself
She s like the fast food
I ll regret it after
And I needed money
But I m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she s all I need
Tell her that she s more
Than a one night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that she s more
Than a one night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don t I ll tell her myself
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That she s more
Than a one night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she s more
Than a one night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don t I ll tell her myself
She s reinventing loving me
When we re resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5 01
Like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed
And I m way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa where we lay I wanna stay inside all day
And it s cold outside again
And we re both so high
We could fly to Berlin Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I ll take ya
But I d rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you
When the morning comes
We re not watchingFormula 1
It s not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with
Friends on T4
Two boiled and brew
Two sugars ain t too sweet for you
On the sofa where we lay I wanna stay inside all day
And it s cold outside again
And we re still so high
We could fly to Berlin Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I ll take ya
But I d rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you
And it feels like I m flying
And it feels like
We could go to Berlin Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York
That is where I will take ya Paris Rome to Rio
Passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want
Say the word and I ll take ya
But I d rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa
On the sofa with you
I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits
Light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We ll stay quiet
Underneath shooting stars
If it helps you sleep
And hold me tight
Don t let me breathe
Feeling like
You won t believe
There s a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don t feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
Teach my skin
Those new tricks
Warm me up
With your lips
Heart to heart
Melt me down
It s too cold
In this town
Close your eyes
Lean on me
Face to mouth
Lips to cheek
Feeling numb
In my feet
You re the one
To help me
Get to sleep
And hold me tight
Don t let me breathe
Feeling like
You won t believe
There s a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don t feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
It s only been
One night of love
And maybe
That is not enough
Hold me tight
Don t let me breathe
Feeling like
You won t believe
It s only been
One night of love
And maybe
That s not enough
Hold me tight
Don t let me breathe
Feeling like
You won t believe
There s a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don t feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
Well my friend it seems we ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you
Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you re too cold
And she said I can put away all those lies
And show you there s no surprise in me
Well still you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that s what s going on
Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
You break me
It s been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left me
All that s left is shattered hearts
It s plain enough for us to see that
You ve got me
You ve got me
We re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It s no fuss
I m not in love
Twisted tunes a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You ve got me
You ve got me
We re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It s no fuss
I m not in love
I lost it in your kiss your lips
Sweetness in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer s touch
It s true
I m glad I m not you
Sara what you do is enlighten my mind
Oh wow I said
Sara what you do is make my soul unwind
Hey now
Cos your hair is blonde your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I m in a mood
So I thought I d write a song for you
And may I say you look like an angel today
May I say take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
Cos you are great I thought I d say that
Sara reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow I said
Sara you say that you don t look good when you do
Even with that soul
Your hair is blonde your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I m in a mood
So I thought I d write a song for you
And may I say you look like an angel today
May I say take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
Cos you are great I thought I d say that
May I say you look great
May I play this to make your day
I felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I can t forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See I was wrong on how I hate you
And it s the worst thing that I did
When I read through you
You weren t translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I d be free from it
See all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on I m back in my mood
See I got drunk and said I loved you
And it s the worst thing that I did
When I read through you
You weren t translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I d be free from it
Now it seems I ve been young dug my hole in the ground
To me there s only up there ain t no point in looking down
However hard I try I only get weaker
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold
What you gotta do is never get yourself down
Bastards do that for you get you deeper in the ground
Keep out of trouble ain t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now
Move on forget it
Now move on forget it
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and glocks all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top
I m just a normal casual usual everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky
Ed Sheeran Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection s arrived
And as the mist clears homie I arise
From my tomb in disguise
I m all alone Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters guiding advising them all to steady move
Now back up
Move on forget it
Now move on forget it
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected infected with the who s who of music
Who did it who is it who s in it who what the fuck does it matter
Chitter chatter don t matter yidder yidder yadder
It don t matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy needy world can you hear me
Yeah yeah can you hear me
Face me are you tired of living
Replace she was so unforgiving
And I m so frustrated so dilated
And she s telling me I ve wasted my time
And I m running back like just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night
Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat
Still you re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we re asking for so much more
Now you re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
Face me are you tired of living
Replace she was so unforgiving
And I m so frustrated so dilated
And she s telling me I ve wasted my time
And I m running back like just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night
Time past heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time cos I won t mind
I doubt if I even know that I m awake
And still you re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we re asking for so much more
Now you re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
I found the words to say how I feel
But I just can t spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That I m a different man with a different tune
I didn t find love until last June
But I lost it just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
Cos I need something anything to replace you
Or something close
Just give me a pen and I ll write my worries
Now and again I ll try and not see that you don t care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life s bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don t care
And hey I don t speak that language of youth
And hey oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile
They ve written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don t care
What ever happened to the youth and culture
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don t care
And hey I don t speak that language of youth
And hey oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile
Sorrow and sadness bitterness grief
Memories I have of you
Won t leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there
I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I d find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again
In Milltown there s a pub
It s there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I ll banish lonesome thoughts
But they ll return again
I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I ll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog
Sorrow and sadness bitterness grief
Memories I have of you
Won t leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there
Sing the song Celestial Man
Shake the thing your mother gave ya
Tear your lungs out scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
I d wager that you re gonna take it
Make you fight nature born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark put on the light
And he said You and your big cheeks have got me
Along with Disarm and Flooded Quarry
Turn off the base with the beat box detox
Pull off the pace while you sing with no socks
Lampshades carpets the stage black
You make the room s hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent ignore that
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain t wrong
He s got me singing to Amerikan Folk Song
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Don t talk only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom boom chikka boom
Jp beat box feet as flip flops
Doing the hip hop mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up up by the mic stand
This ain t no fake it s music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout Wow
How did they even have the guts to do it
If your name s Nizlopi then there ain t much to it
Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around now
Come on now
Dry your eyes
I m sick of all your lies
I ve grown to despise you
Already sick of what you re saying
Hoping now I m only praying
My baby s gone away
And I ve already packed my bags
You didn t know me
I ve run away
You couldn t show me
What you have to say
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
You ll never leave me alone
Now I m off on my own
I ll never ring your phone again
And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you
I d be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I ve still gone to pack my bags
You didn t know me
I ve run away
You couldn t show me
What you have to say
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
Well I ve walked this street
Well I ve walked this street before
And everyone s locked up their door
Cos they heard me coming
And I ve been running
From what
I don t know if she s there
Or if she s cares
It s taken you a long time to see
You ve got a goldfish memory
This song s for you not for me
In misery
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn t last
Now I ve put the past behind me
And I m running
From what
I don t know if she s there
Or if she cares
It s taken you a long time to see
You ve got a goldfish memory
This song s for you not for me
In misery
It s taken you a long time to see
In misery
And everyone s locked up their door
Cos they heard me coming
And I ve been running
From what
I don t know if she s there
Or if she s cares
It s taken you a long time to see
You ve got a goldfish memory
This song s for you not for me
In misery
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn t last
Now I ve put the past behind me
And I m running
From what
I don t know if she s there
Or if she cares
It s taken you a long time to see
You ve got a goldfish memory
This song s for you not for me
In misery
It s taken you a long time to see
In misery
Strings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don t trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy
Cos I m your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
Typical average teen
Cos I m your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
Typical average teen
Everything s in a haze
Yeah the drink s got me in a daze
Everything s blurry
Oh what s happened to me
Say I m your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
Typical average teen
Now I m your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
Typical average teen
I m standing on a mountain
Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone
The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget
But not yet
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it s true
I love you
I love you
How can I tell you
I don t know what to say
This chance that I won t miss
But I miss you anyway
I feel your pain
It s turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home
But then you came
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it s true
I love you
Wishing my life away
These three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it s true
You know it s true
I love you
I love you
I love you
I think I took too much
I m addicted to your touch
But I m crying
In shame again
And now i m high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
Oh well we ve come this far
Your my Venus and I m your Mars
And we ve passed the moon and stars
And I m gone
And now i m high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
And now i m high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
So please come home
